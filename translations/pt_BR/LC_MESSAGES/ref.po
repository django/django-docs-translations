"outras coisas como fixtures, CSS e templates que não estão atrelados à "
"nenhuma aplicação em particular."

"The basic workflow of Django's admin is, in a nutshell, \"select an object, "
"then change it.\" This works well for a majority of use cases. However, if "
"you need to make the same change to many objects at once, this workflow can "
"be quite tedious."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In these cases, Django's admin lets you write and register \"actions\" -- "
"functions that get called with a list of objects selected on the change list "
"page."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you look at any change list in the admin, you'll see this feature in "
"action; Django ships with a \"delete selected objects\" action available to "
"all models. For example, here's the user module from Django's built-in :mod:"
"`django.contrib.auth` app:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The \"delete selected objects\" action uses :meth:`QuerySet.delete() <django."
"db.models.query.QuerySet.delete>` for efficiency reasons, which has an "
"important caveat: your model's ``delete()`` method will not be called."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you wish to override this behavior, you can override :meth:`.ModelAdmin."
"delete_queryset` or write a custom action which does deletion in your "

msgid "Writing actions"
msgstr ""

msgid "The easiest way to explain actions is by example, so let's dive in."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A common use case for admin actions is the bulk updating of a model. Imagine "
"a news application with an ``Article`` model::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A common task we might perform with a model like this is to update an "
"article's status from \"draft\" to \"published\". We could easily do this in "
"the admin one article at a time, but if we wanted to bulk-publish a group of "
"articles, it'd be tedious. So, let's write an action that lets us change an "
"article's status to \"published.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "Writing action functions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First, we'll need to write a function that gets called when the action is "
"triggered from the admin. Action functions are regular functions that take "
"three arguments:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The current :class:`ModelAdmin`"
msgstr ""

msgid "An :class:`~django.http.HttpRequest` representing the current request,"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A :class:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet` containing the set of objects "
"selected by the user."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Our publish-these-articles function won't need the :class:`ModelAdmin` or "
"the request object, but we will use the queryset::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For the best performance, we're using the queryset's :ref:`update method "
"<topics-db-queries-update>`. Other types of actions might need to deal with "
"each object individually; in these cases we'd iterate over the queryset::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"That's actually all there is to writing an action! However, we'll take one "
"more optional-but-useful step and give the action a \"nice\" title in the "
"admin. By default, this action would appear in the action list as \"Make "
"published\" -- the function name, with underscores replaced by spaces. "
"That's fine, but we can provide a better, more human-friendly name by using "
"the :func:`~django.contrib.admin.action` decorator on the ``make_published`` "
"function::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This might look familiar; the admin's :attr:`~django.contrib.admin."
"ModelAdmin.list_display` option uses a similar technique with the :func:"
"`~django.contrib.admin.display` decorator to provide human-readable "
"descriptions for callback functions registered there, too."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``description`` argument to the :func:`~django.contrib.admin.action` "
"decorator is equivalent to setting the ``short_description`` attribute on "
"the action function directly in previous versions. Setting the attribute "
"directly is still supported for backward compatibility."
msgstr ""

msgid "Adding actions to the :class:`ModelAdmin`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Next, we'll need to inform our :class:`ModelAdmin` of the action. This works "
"just like any other configuration option. So, the complete ``admin.py`` with "
"the action and its registration would look like::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"That code will give us an admin change list that looks something like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"That's really all there is to it! If you're itching to write your own "
"actions, you now know enough to get started. The rest of this document "
"covers more advanced techniques."
msgstr ""

msgid "Handling errors in actions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If there are foreseeable error conditions that may occur while running your "
"action, you should gracefully inform the user of the problem. This means "
"handling exceptions and using :meth:`django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin."
"message_user` to display a user friendly description of the problem in the "
"response."
msgstr ""

msgid "Advanced action techniques"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There's a couple of extra options and possibilities you can exploit for more "
"advanced options."
msgstr ""

msgid "Actions as :class:`ModelAdmin` methods"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The example above shows the ``make_published`` action defined as a function. "
"That's perfectly fine, but it's not perfect from a code design point of "
"view: since the action is tightly coupled to the ``Article`` object, it "
"makes sense to hook the action to the ``ArticleAdmin`` object itself."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can do it like this::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Notice first that we've moved ``make_published`` into a method and renamed "
"the ``modeladmin`` parameter to ``self``, and second that we've now put the "
"string ``'make_published'`` in ``actions`` instead of a direct function "
"reference. This tells the :class:`ModelAdmin` to look up the action as a "
"method."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Defining actions as methods gives the action more idiomatic access to the :"
"class:`ModelAdmin` itself, allowing the action to call any of the methods "
"provided by the admin."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, we can use ``self`` to flash a message to the user informing "
"them that the action was successful::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This make the action match what the admin itself does after successfully "
"performing an action:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Actions that provide intermediate pages"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, after an action is performed the user is redirected back to the "
"original change list page. However, some actions, especially more complex "
"ones, will need to return intermediate pages. For example, the built-in "
"delete action asks for confirmation before deleting the selected objects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To provide an intermediary page, return an :class:`~django.http."
"HttpResponse` (or subclass) from your action. For example, you might write "
"an export function that uses Django's :doc:`serialization functions </topics/"
"serialization>` to dump some selected objects as JSON::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Generally, something like the above isn't considered a great idea. Most of "
"the time, the best practice will be to return an :class:`~django.http."
"HttpResponseRedirect` and redirect the user to a view you've written, "
"passing the list of selected objects in the GET query string. This allows "
"you to provide complex interaction logic on the intermediary pages. For "
"example, if you wanted to provide a more complete export function, you'd "
"want to let the user choose a format, and possibly a list of fields to "
"include in the export. The best thing to do would be to write a small action "
"that redirects to your custom export view::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As you can see, the action is rather short; all the complex logic would "
"belong in your export view. This would need to deal with objects of any "
"type, hence the business with the ``ContentType``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Writing this view is left as an exercise to the reader."
msgstr ""

msgid "Making actions available site-wide"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some actions are best if they're made available to *any* object in the admin "
"site -- the export action defined above would be a good candidate. You can "
"make an action globally available using :meth:`AdminSite.add_action()`. For "
"example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This makes the ``export_selected_objects`` action globally available as an "
"action named \"export_selected_objects\". You can explicitly give the action "
"a name -- good if you later want to programmatically :ref:`remove the action "
"<disabling-admin-actions>` -- by passing a second argument to :meth:"
"`AdminSite.add_action()`::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Disabling actions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sometimes you need to disable certain actions -- especially those :ref:"
"`registered site-wide <adminsite-actions>` -- for particular objects. "
"There's a few ways you can disable actions:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Disabling a site-wide action"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you need to disable a :ref:`site-wide action <adminsite-actions>` you can "

msgid ""
"For example, you can use this method to remove the built-in \"delete "
"selected objects\" action::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once you've done the above, that action will no longer be available site-"

"When you specify an intermediary model using the ``through`` argument to a :"

"Unfortunately, the shapefile data format does not allow for greater "

"``SearchQuery`` translates the terms the user provides into a search query "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To accomplish this, use the :attr:`~Form.initial` argument to a :class:"

msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "Using validators"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Django's form (and model) fields support use of utility functions and "
"classes known as validators. A validator is a callable object or function "
"that takes a value and returns nothing if the value is valid or raises a :"
"exc:`~django.core.exceptions.ValidationError` if not. These can be passed to "
"a field's constructor, via the field's ``validators`` argument, or defined "
"on the :class:`~django.forms.Field` class itself with the "
"``default_validators`` attribute."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Validators can be used to validate values inside the field, let's have a "
"look at Django's ``SlugField``::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As you can see, ``SlugField`` is a ``CharField`` with a customized validator "
"that validates that submitted text obeys to some character rules. This can "
"also be done on field definition so::"
msgstr ""

msgid "is equivalent to::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Common cases such as validating against an email or a regular expression can "
"be handled using existing validator classes available in Django. For "
"example, ``validators.validate_slug`` is an instance of a :class:`~django."
"core.validators.RegexValidator` constructed with the first argument being "
"the pattern: ``^[-a-zA-Z0-9_]+$``. See the section on :doc:`writing "
"validators </ref/validators>` to see a list of what is already available and "
"for an example of how to write a validator."
msgstr ""

msgid "Form field default cleaning"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Let's first create a custom form field that validates its input is a string "
"containing comma-separated email addresses. The full class looks like this::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Every form that uses this field will have these methods run before anything "
"else can be done with the field's data. This is cleaning that is specific to "
"this type of field, regardless of how it is subsequently used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Let's create a ``ContactForm`` to demonstrate how you'd use this field::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use ``MultiEmailField`` like any other form field. When the ``is_valid()`` "
"method is called on the form, the ``MultiEmailField.clean()`` method will be "
"run as part of the cleaning process and it will, in turn, call the custom "
"``to_python()`` and ``validate()`` methods."
msgstr ""

msgid "Cleaning a specific field attribute"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Continuing on from the previous example, suppose that in our "
"``ContactForm``, we want to make sure that the ``recipients`` field always "
"contains the address ``\"fred@example.com\"``. This is validation that is "
"specific to our form, so we don't want to put it into the general "
"``MultiEmailField`` class. Instead, we write a cleaning method that operates "
"on the ``recipients`` field, like so::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Cleaning and validating fields that depend on each other"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Suppose we add another requirement to our contact form: if the ``cc_myself`` "
"field is ``True``, the ``subject`` must contain the word ``\"help\"``. We "
"are performing validation on more than one field at a time, so the form's :"
"meth:`~Form.clean()` method is a good spot to do this. Notice that we are "
"talking about the ``clean()`` method on the form here, whereas earlier we "
"were writing a ``clean()`` method on a field. It's important to keep the "
"field and form difference clear when working out where to validate things. "
"Fields are single data points, forms are a collection of fields."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By the time the form's ``clean()`` method is called, all the individual "
"field clean methods will have been run (the previous two sections), so "
"``self.cleaned_data`` will be populated with any data that has survived so "
"far. So you also need to remember to allow for the fact that the fields you "
"are wanting to validate might not have survived the initial individual field "
"checks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are two ways to report any errors from this step. Probably the most "
"common method is to display the error at the top of the form. To create such "
"an error, you can raise a ``ValidationError`` from the ``clean()`` method. "
"For example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this code, if the validation error is raised, the form will display an "
"error message at the top of the form (normally) describing the problem. Such "
"errors are non-field errors, which are displayed in the template with "
"``{{ form.non_field_errors }}``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The call to ``super().clean()`` in the example code ensures that any "
"validation logic in parent classes is maintained. If your form inherits "
"another that doesn't return a ``cleaned_data`` dictionary in its ``clean()`` "
"method (doing so is optional), then don't assign ``cleaned_data`` to the "
"result of the ``super()`` call and use ``self.cleaned_data`` instead::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The second approach for reporting validation errors might involve assigning "
"the error message to one of the fields. In this case, let's assign an error "
"message to both the \"subject\" and \"cc_myself\" rows in the form display. "
"Be careful when doing this in practice, since it can lead to confusing form "
"output. We're showing what is possible here and leaving it up to you and "
"your designers to work out what works effectively in your particular "
"situation. Our new code (replacing the previous sample) looks like this::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The second argument of ``add_error()`` can be a string, or preferably an "
"instance of ``ValidationError``. See :ref:`raising-validation-error` for "
"more details. Note that ``add_error()`` automatically removes the field from "
"``cleaned_data``."

msgstr ""

msgid "``F()`` expressions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An ``F()`` object represents the value of a model field, transformed value "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Instead, Django uses the ``F()`` object to generate an SQL expression that "
"describes the required operation at the database level."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Let's try this with an example. Normally, one might do something like this::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here, we have pulled the value of ``reporter.stories_filed`` from the "
"database into memory and manipulated it using familiar Python operators, and "
"then saved the object back to the database. But instead we could also have "
"done::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Although ``reporter.stories_filed = F('stories_filed') + 1`` looks like a "
"normal Python assignment of value to an instance attribute, in fact it's an "
"SQL construct describing an operation on the database."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When Django encounters an instance of ``F()``, it overrides the standard "
"Python operators to create an encapsulated SQL expression; in this case, one "
"which instructs the database to increment the database field represented by "
"``reporter.stories_filed``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Whatever value is or was on ``reporter.stories_filed``, Python never gets to "
"know about it - it is dealt with entirely by the database. All Python does, "
"through Django's ``F()`` class, is create the SQL syntax to refer to the "
"field and describe the operation."
msgstr ""

msgid "To access the new value saved this way, the object must be reloaded::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As well as being used in operations on single instances as above, ``F()`` "

"reduces the two queries we were using above - the ``get()`` and the :meth:"
"`~Model.save()` - to just one::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We can also use :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.update()` to "
"increment the field value on multiple objects - which could be very much "
"faster than pulling them all into Python from the database, looping over "
"them, incrementing the field value of each one, and saving each one back to "
"the database::"
msgstr ""

msgid "``F()`` therefore can offer performance advantages by:"
msgstr ""

msgid "getting the database, rather than Python, to do work"

msgstr ""

msgid "Support for transforms of the field was added."

msgid "Avoiding race conditions using ``F()``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Another useful benefit of ``F()`` is that having the database - rather than "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If two Python threads execute the code in the first example above, one "
"thread could retrieve, increment, and save a field's value after the other "
"has retrieved it from the database. The value that the second thread saves "
"will be based on the original value; the work of the first thread will be "
"lost."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the database is responsible for updating the field, the process is more "
"robust: it will only ever update the field based on the value of the field "
"in the database when the :meth:`~Model.save()` or ``update()`` is executed, "
"rather than based on its value when the instance was retrieved."
msgstr ""

msgid "``F()`` assignments persist after ``Model.save()``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``F()`` objects assigned to model fields persist after saving the model "
"instance and will be applied on each :meth:`~Model.save()`. For example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``stories_filed`` will be updated twice in this case. If it's initially "
"``1``, the final value will be ``3``. This persistence can be avoided by "
"reloading the model object after saving it, for example, by using :meth:"
"`~Model.refresh_from_db()`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using ``F()`` in filters"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``F()`` is also very useful in ``QuerySet`` filters, where they make it "

"**len().** A ``QuerySet`` is evaluated when you call ``len()`` on it. This, "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note: If you only need to determine the number of records in the set (and "

msgid ""
"On PostgreSQL only, you can pass positional arguments (``*fields``) in order "

msgid ""
"If you have a field called ``foo`` that is a :class:`~django.db.models."

msgid ""
"A variable can only be called if it has no required arguments. Otherwise, "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A good example is the :meth:`~django.db.models.Model.delete` method on each "
"Django model object. The template system shouldn't be allowed to do "
"something like this::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To prevent this, set an ``alters_data`` attribute on the callable variable. "
"The template system won't call a variable if it has ``alters_data=True`` "
"set, and will instead replace the variable with ``string_if_invalid``, "
"unconditionally.  The dynamically-generated :meth:`~django.db.models.Model."
"delete` and :meth:`~django.db.models.Model.save` methods on Django model "
"objects get ``alters_data=True`` automatically. Example::"
msgstr ""

"Occasionally you may want to turn off this feature for other reasons, and "
"tell the template system to leave a variable uncalled no matter what.  To do "
"so, set a ``do_not_call_in_templates`` attribute on the callable with the "
"value ``True``.  The template system then will act as if your variable is "
"not callable (allowing you to access attributes of the callable, for "
"example)."
msgstr ""

msgid "How invalid variables are handled"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Generally, if a variable doesn't exist, the template system inserts the "

"set to ``''`` (the empty string) by default."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Filters that are applied to an invalid variable will only be applied if "

"ignored."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This behavior is slightly different for the ``if``, ``for`` and ``regroup`` "
"template tags. If an invalid variable is provided to one of these template "
"tags, the variable will be interpreted as ``None``. Filters are always "
"applied to invalid variables within these template tags."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If ``string_if_invalid`` contains a ``'%s'``, the format marker will be "
"replaced with the name of the invalid variable."
msgstr ""

msgid "For debug purposes only!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While ``string_if_invalid`` can be a useful debugging tool, it is a bad idea "
"to turn it on as a 'development default'."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Many templates, including some of Django's, rely upon the silence of the "
"template system when a nonexistent variable is encountered. If you assign a "

msgid "Limitations with string literals"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Django's template language has no way to escape the characters used for its "

"to output character sequences like ``{%`` and ``%}``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A similar issue exists if you want to include these sequences in template "
"filter or tag arguments. For example, when parsing a block tag, Django's "
"template parser looks for the first occurrence of ``%}`` after a ``{%``. "
"This prevents the use of ``\"%}\"`` as a string literal. For example, a "
"``TemplateSyntaxError`` will be raised for the following expressions::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The same issue can be triggered by using a reserved sequence in filter "

msgid "Variables"

msgid ""
"Variables look like this: ``{{ variable }}``. When the template engine "
"encounters a variable, it evaluates that variable and replaces it with the "
"result. Variable names consist of any combination of alphanumeric characters "
"and the underscore (``\"_\"``) but may not start with an underscore, and may "

"This lookup order can cause some unexpected behavior with objects that "
"override dictionary lookup. For example, consider the following code snippet "
"that attempts to loop over a ``collections.defaultdict``::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Because dictionary lookup happens first, that behavior kicks in and provides "
"a default value instead of using the intended ``.items()`` method. In this "
"case, consider converting to a dictionary first."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the above example, ``{{ section.title }}`` will be replaced with the "
"``title`` attribute of the ``section`` object."

"If you use a variable that doesn't exist, the template system will insert "
"the value of the ``string_if_invalid`` option, which is set to ``''`` (the "
"empty string) by default."

msgid ""
"Variable attributes that begin with an underscore may not be accessed as "
"they're generally considered private."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can modify variables for display by using **filters**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Filters look like this: ``{{ name|lower }}``. This displays the value of the "
"``{{ name }}`` variable after being filtered through the :tfilter:`lower` "
"filter, which converts text to lowercase. Use a pipe (``|``) to apply a "
"filter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Filters can be \"chained.\" The output of one filter is applied to the next. "
"``{{ text|escape|linebreaks }}`` is a common idiom for escaping text "
"contents, then converting line breaks to ``<p>`` tags."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some filters take arguments. A filter argument looks like this: ``{{ bio|"
"truncatewords:30 }}``. This will display the first 30 words of the ``bio`` "

"more commonly used template filters:"
msgstr ""

msgid ":tfilter:`default`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a variable is false or empty, use given default. Otherwise, use the value "
"of the variable. For example::"
msgstr ""

"If ``value`` isn't provided or is empty, the above will display \"``nothing``"
"\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ":tfilter:`length`"

"admindocs`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tags"
msgstr "Tags"

msgid ""
"Tags look like this: ``{% tag %}``. Tags are more complex than variables: "
"Some create text in the output, some control flow by performing loops or "
"logic, and some load external information into the template to be used by "
"later variables."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some tags require beginning and ending tags (i.e. ``{% tag %} ... tag "
"contents ... {% endtag %}``)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Django ships with about two dozen built-in template tags. You can read all "
"about them in the :ref:`built-in tag reference <ref-templates-builtins-"

"Evaluates a variable, and if that variable is \"true\" the contents of the "

"``athlete_in_locker_room_list`` is not empty, the message \"Athletes should "
"be out...\" will be displayed. If both lists are empty, \"No athletes.\" "
"will be displayed."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can also use filters and various operators in the :ttag:`if` tag::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While the above example works, be aware that most template filters return "
"strings, so mathematical comparisons using filters will generally not work "
"as you expect. :tfilter:`length` is an exception."

msgstr ""

msgid "Template inheritance"
msgstr "Herança de modelo"

msgid ""
"The most powerful -- and thus the most complex -- part of Django's template "
"engine is template inheritance. Template inheritance allows you to build a "
"base \"skeleton\" template that contains all the common elements of your "
"site and defines **blocks** that child templates can override."
msgstr ""

msgid "Let's look at template inheritance by starting with an example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This template, which we'll call ``base.html``, defines an HTML skeleton "
"document that you might use for a two-column page. It's the job of \"child\" "
"templates to fill the empty blocks with content."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this example, the :ttag:`block` tag defines three blocks that child "
"templates can fill in. All the :ttag:`block` tag does is to tell the "
"template engine that a child template may override those portions of the "
"template."
msgstr ""

msgid "A child template might look like this::"
msgstr "Um modelo filho deve se parecer com isso::"

msgid ""
"The :ttag:`extends` tag is the key here. It tells the template engine that "
"this template \"extends\" another template. When the template system "
"evaluates this template, first it locates the parent -- in this case, \"base."
"html\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"At that point, the template engine will notice the three :ttag:`block` tags "
"in ``base.html`` and replace those blocks with the contents of the child "
"template. Depending on the value of ``blog_entries``, the output might look "
"like::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that since the child template didn't define the ``sidebar`` block, the "
"value from the parent template is used instead. Content within a ``{% block "
"%}`` tag in a parent template is always used as a fallback."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use as many levels of inheritance as needed. One common way of using "
"inheritance is the following three-level approach:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create a ``base.html`` template that holds the main look-and-feel of your "
"site."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create a ``base_SECTIONNAME.html`` template for each \"section\" of your "
"site. For example, ``base_news.html``, ``base_sports.html``. These templates "
"all extend ``base.html`` and include section-specific styles/design."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create individual templates for each type of page, such as a news article or "
"blog entry. These templates extend the appropriate section template."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This approach maximizes code reuse and helps to add items to shared content "
"areas, such as section-wide navigation."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here are some tips for working with inheritance:"
msgstr "Aqui estão algumas dicas para trabalhar com herança:"

msgid ""
"If you use :ttag:`{% extends %}<extends>` in a template, it must be the "
"first template tag in that template. Template inheritance won't work, "
"otherwise."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"More :ttag:`{% block %}<block>` tags in your base templates are better. "
"Remember, child templates don't have to define all parent blocks, so you can "
"fill in reasonable defaults in a number of blocks, then only define the ones "
"you need later. It's better to have more hooks than fewer hooks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you find yourself duplicating content in a number of templates, it "
"probably means you should move that content to a ``{% block %}`` in a parent "
"template."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you need to get the content of the block from the parent template, the "
"``{{ block.super }}`` variable will do the trick. This is useful if you want "
"to add to the contents of a parent block instead of completely overriding "
"it. Data inserted using ``{{ block.super }}`` will not be automatically "
"escaped (see the `next section`_), since it was already escaped, if "
"necessary, in the parent template."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By using the same template name as you are inheriting from, :ttag:`{% "
"extends %}<extends>` can be used to inherit a template at the same time as "
"overriding it. Combined with ``{{ block.super }}``, this can be a powerful "
"way to make small customizations. See :ref:"
"`extending_an_overridden_template` in the *Overriding templates* How-to for "
"a full example."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Variables created outside of a :ttag:`{% block %}<block>` using the template "
"tag ``as`` syntax can't be used inside the block. For example, this template "
"doesn't render anything::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For extra readability, you can optionally give a *name* to your ``{% "
"endblock %}`` tag. For example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In larger templates, this technique helps you see which ``{% block %}`` tags "
"are being closed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, note that you can't define multiple :ttag:`block` tags with the "
"same name in the same template. This limitation exists because a block tag "
"works in \"both\" directions. That is, a block tag doesn't just provide a "
"hole to fill -- it also defines the content that fills the hole in the "
"*parent*. If there were two similarly-named :ttag:`block` tags in a "
"template, that template's parent wouldn't know which one of the blocks' "
"content to use."
msgstr ""

msgid "Automatic HTML escaping"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When generating HTML from templates, there's always a risk that a variable "
"will include characters that affect the resulting HTML. For example, "
"consider this template fragment::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"At first, this seems like a harmless way to display a user's name, but "
"consider what would happen if the user entered their name as this::"
msgstr ""

msgid "With this name value, the template would be rendered as::"
msgstr ""

msgid "...which means the browser would pop-up a JavaScript alert box!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Similarly, what if the name contained a ``'<'`` symbol, like this?"
msgstr ""

msgid "That would result in a rendered template like this::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"...which, in turn, would result in the remainder of the web page being "
"bolded!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Clearly, user-submitted data shouldn't be trusted blindly and inserted "
"directly into your web pages, because a malicious user could use this kind "
"of hole to do potentially bad things. This type of security exploit is "
"called a `Cross Site Scripting`_ (XSS) attack."
msgstr ""

msgid "To avoid this problem, you have two options:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One, you can make sure to run each untrusted variable through the :tfilter:"
"`escape` filter (documented below), which converts potentially harmful HTML "
"characters to unharmful ones. This was the default solution in Django for "
"its first few years, but the problem is that it puts the onus on *you*, the "
"developer / template author, to ensure you're escaping everything. It's easy "
"to forget to escape data."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Two, you can take advantage of Django's automatic HTML escaping. The "
"remainder of this section describes how auto-escaping works."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default in Django, every template automatically escapes the output of "
"every variable tag. Specifically, these five characters are escaped:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Again, we stress that this behavior is on by default. If you're using "
"Django's template system, you're protected."
msgstr ""

msgid "How to turn it off"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you don't want data to be auto-escaped, on a per-site, per-template level "
"or per-variable level, you can turn it off in several ways."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Why would you want to turn it off? Because sometimes, template variables "
"contain data that you *intend* to be rendered as raw HTML, in which case you "
"don't want their contents to be escaped. For example, you might store a blob "
"of HTML in your database and want to embed that directly into your template. "
"Or, you might be using Django's template system to produce text that is "
"*not* HTML -- like an email message, for instance."
msgstr ""

msgid "For individual variables"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To disable auto-escaping for an individual variable, use the :tfilter:`safe` "
"filter::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Think of *safe* as shorthand for *safe from further escaping* or *can be "
"safely interpreted as HTML*. In this example, if ``data`` contains "
"``'<b>'``, the output will be::"
msgstr ""

msgid "For template blocks"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To control auto-escaping for a template, wrap the template (or a particular "
"section of the template) in the :ttag:`autoescape` tag, like so::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :ttag:`autoescape` tag takes either ``on`` or ``off`` as its argument. "
"At times, you might want to force auto-escaping when it would otherwise be "
"disabled. Here is an example template::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The auto-escaping tag passes its effect onto templates that extend the "
"current one as well as templates included via the :ttag:`include` tag, just "
"like all block tags. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "base.html"
msgstr ""

msgid "child.html"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Because auto-escaping is turned off in the base template, it will also be "
"turned off in the child template, resulting in the following rendered HTML "
"when the ``greeting`` variable contains the string ``<b>Hello!</b>``::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Generally, template authors don't need to worry about auto-escaping very "
"much. Developers on the Python side (people writing views and custom "
"filters) need to think about the cases in which data shouldn't be escaped, "
"and mark data appropriately, so things Just Work in the template."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you're creating a template that might be used in situations where you're "
"not sure whether auto-escaping is enabled, then add an :tfilter:`escape` "
"filter to any variable that needs escaping. When auto-escaping is on, "
"there's no danger of the :tfilter:`escape` filter *double-escaping* data -- "
"the :tfilter:`escape` filter does not affect auto-escaped variables."
msgstr ""

msgid "String literals and automatic escaping"
msgstr ""

msgid "As we mentioned earlier, filter arguments can be strings::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All string literals are inserted **without** any automatic escaping into the "
"template -- they act as if they were all passed through the :tfilter:`safe` "
"filter. The reasoning behind this is that the template author is in control "
"of what goes into the string literal, so they can make sure the text is "
"correctly escaped when the template is written."
msgstr ""

msgid "This means you would write ::"
msgstr ""

msgid "...rather than::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This doesn't affect what happens to data coming from the variable itself. "
"The variable's contents are still automatically escaped, if necessary, "
"because they're beyond the control of the template author."
msgstr ""

msgid "Accessing method calls"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Most method calls attached to objects are also available from within "
"templates. This means that templates have access to much more than just "
"class attributes (like field names) and variables passed in from views. For "
"example, the Django ORM provides the :ref:`\"entry_set\"<topics-db-queries-"
"related>` syntax for finding a collection of objects related on a foreign "
"key. Therefore, given a model called \"comment\" with a foreign key "
"relationship to a model called \"task\" you can loop through all comments "
"attached to a given task like this::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Similarly, :doc:`QuerySets</ref/models/querysets>` provide a ``count()`` "
"method to count the number of objects they contain. Therefore, you can "
"obtain a count of all comments related to the current task with::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also access methods you've explicitly defined on your own models:"
msgstr ""

msgid "models.py"
msgstr ""

msgid "template.html"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Because Django intentionally limits the amount of logic processing available "
"in the template language, it is not possible to pass arguments to method "
"calls accessed from within templates. Data should be calculated in views, "
"then passed to templates for display."
msgstr ""

msgid "Custom tag and filter libraries"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Certain applications provide custom tag and filter libraries. To access them "
"in a template, ensure the application is in :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS` (we'd "
"add ``'django.contrib.humanize'`` for this example), and then use the :ttag:"
"`load` tag in a template::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the above, the :ttag:`load` tag loads the ``humanize`` tag library, which "
"then makes the ``intcomma`` filter available for use. If you've enabled :mod:"
"`django.contrib.admindocs`, you can consult the documentation area in your "
"admin to find the list of custom libraries in your installation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :ttag:`load` tag can take multiple library names, separated by spaces. "
"Example::"

"See :doc:`/howto/custom-template-tags` for information on writing your own "
"custom template libraries."
msgstr ""

msgid "Custom libraries and template inheritance"

"When you load a custom tag or filter library, the tags/filters are only made "
"available to the current template -- not any parent or child templates along "
"the template-inheritance path."
msgstr ""

"For example, if a template ``foo.html`` has ``{% load humanize %}``, a child "
"template (e.g., one that has ``{% extends \"foo.html\" %}``) will *not* have "

msgid "Creating the database"
msgstr ""

msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgid "General string handling"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Whenever you use strings with Django -- e.g., in database lookups, template "
"rendering or anywhere else -- you have two choices for encoding those "
"strings. You can use normal strings or bytestrings (starting with a 'b')."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A bytestring does not carry any information with it about its encoding. For "
"that reason, we have to make an assumption, and Django assumes that all "
"bytestrings are in UTF-8."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you pass a string to Django that has been encoded in some other format, "
"things will go wrong in interesting ways. Usually, Django will raise a "
"``UnicodeDecodeError`` at some point."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If your code only uses ASCII data, it's safe to use your normal strings, "
"passing them around at will, because ASCII is a subset of UTF-8."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Don't be fooled into thinking that if your :setting:`DEFAULT_CHARSET` "
"setting is set to something other than ``'utf-8'`` you can use that other "
"encoding in your bytestrings! :setting:`DEFAULT_CHARSET` only applies to the "
"strings generated as the result of template rendering (and email). Django "
"will always assume UTF-8 encoding for internal bytestrings. The reason for "
"this is that the :setting:`DEFAULT_CHARSET` setting is not actually under "
"your control (if you are the application developer). It's under the control "
"of the person installing and using your application -- and if that person "
"chooses a different setting, your code must still continue to work. Ergo, it "
"cannot rely on that setting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In most cases when Django is dealing with strings, it will convert them to "
"strings before doing anything else. So, as a general rule, if you pass in a "
"bytestring, be prepared to receive a string back in the result."
msgstr ""

msgid "Translated strings"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Aside from strings and bytestrings, there's a third type of string-like "
"object you may encounter when using Django. The framework's "
"internationalization features introduce the concept of a \"lazy translation"
"\" -- a string that has been marked as translated but whose actual "
"translation result isn't determined until the object is used in a string. "
"This feature is useful in cases where the translation locale is unknown "
"until the string is used, even though the string might have originally been "
"created when the code was first imported."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Normally, you won't have to worry about lazy translations. Just be aware "
"that if you examine an object and it claims to be a ``django.utils."
"functional.__proxy__`` object, it is a lazy translation. Calling ``str()`` "
"with the lazy translation as the argument will generate a string in the "
"current locale."

msgid "Useful utility functions"

msgid ""
"``smart_str(s, encoding='utf-8', strings_only=False, errors='strict')`` "

"form input data, which might not be UTF-8 encoded.) The ``strings_only`` "
"parameter, if set to True, will result in Python numbers, booleans and "
"``None`` not being converted to a string (they keep their original types). "

msgid ""
"``force_str(s, encoding='utf-8', strings_only=False, errors='strict')`` is "
"identical to ``smart_str()`` in almost all cases. The difference is when the "
"first argument is a :ref:`lazy translation <lazy-translations>` instance. "
"While ``smart_str()`` preserves lazy translations, ``force_str()`` forces "
"those objects to a string (causing the translation to occur). Normally, "
"you'll want to use ``smart_str()``. However, ``force_str()`` is useful in "
"template tags and filters that absolutely *must* have a string to work with, "
"not just something that can be converted to a string."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``smart_bytes(s, encoding='utf-8', strings_only=False, errors='strict')`` is "
"essentially the opposite of ``smart_str()``. It forces the first argument to "
"a bytestring. The ``strings_only`` parameter has the same behavior as for "
"``smart_str()`` and ``force_str()``. This is slightly different semantics "
"from Python's builtin ``str()`` function, but the difference is needed in a "
"few places within Django's internals."
msgstr ""

msgid ""

msgid "URI and IRI handling"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Web frameworks have to deal with URLs (which are a type of IRI). One "
"requirement of URLs is that they are encoded using only ASCII characters. "
"However, in an international environment, you might need to construct a URL "
"from an :rfc:`IRI <3987>` -- very loosely speaking, a :rfc:`URI <2396>` that "
"can contain Unicode characters. Use these functions for quoting and "
"converting an IRI to a URI:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :func:`django.utils.encoding.iri_to_uri()` function, which implements "
"the conversion from IRI to URI as required by :rfc:`3987#section-3.1`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :func:`urllib.parse.quote` and :func:`urllib.parse.quote_plus` functions "
"from Python's standard library."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These two groups of functions have slightly different purposes, and it's "
"important to keep them straight. Normally, you would use ``quote()`` on the "
"individual portions of the IRI or URI path so that any reserved characters "
"such as '&' or '%' are correctly encoded. Then, you apply ``iri_to_uri()`` "
"to the full IRI and it converts any non-ASCII characters to the correct "
"encoded values."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Technically, it isn't correct to say that ``iri_to_uri()`` implements the "
"full algorithm in the IRI specification. It doesn't (yet) perform the "
"international domain name encoding portion of the algorithm."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``iri_to_uri()`` function will not change ASCII characters that are "
"otherwise permitted in a URL. So, for example, the character '%' is not "
"further encoded when passed to ``iri_to_uri()``. This means you can pass a "
"full URL to this function and it will not mess up the query string or "
"anything like that."
msgstr ""

msgid "An example might clarify things here::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you look carefully, you can see that the portion that was generated by "
"``quote()`` in the second example was not double-quoted when passed to "
"``iri_to_uri()``. This is a very important and useful feature. It means that "
"you can construct your IRI without worrying about whether it contains non-"
"ASCII characters and then, right at the end, call ``iri_to_uri()`` on the "
"result."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Similarly, Django provides :func:`django.utils.encoding.uri_to_iri()` which "
"implements the conversion from URI to IRI as per :rfc:`3987#section-3.2`."
msgstr ""

msgid "An example to demonstrate::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the first example, the UTF-8 characters are unquoted. In the second, the "
"percent-encodings remain unchanged because they lie outside the valid UTF-8 "
"range or represent a reserved character."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Both ``iri_to_uri()`` and ``uri_to_iri()`` functions are idempotent, which "
"means the following is always true::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"So you can safely call it multiple times on the same URI/IRI without risking "
"double-quoting problems."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Because all strings are returned from the database as ``str`` objects, model "
"fields that are character based (CharField, TextField, URLField, etc.) will "
"contain Unicode values when Django retrieves data from the database. This is "
"*always* the case, even if the data could fit into an ASCII bytestring."

"handles this for you automatically."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you're constructing a URL manually (i.e., *not* using the ``reverse()`` "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use ``force_str()`` in preference to ``smart_str()`` in these places. Tag "
