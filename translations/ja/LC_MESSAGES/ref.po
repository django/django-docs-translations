"The term **project** describes a Django web application. The project Python "
"package is defined primarily by a settings module, but it usually contains "
"other things. For example, when you run  ``django-admin startproject "
"mysite`` you'll get a ``mysite`` project directory that contains a "
"``mysite`` Python package with ``settings.py``, ``urls.py``, and ``wsgi."

msgid ""
"``default_app_config`` allows applications that predate Django 1.7 such as "

msgid ""
"If you're creating a pluggable app called \"Rock ’n’ roll\", here's how you "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can make your application load this :class:`~django.apps.AppConfig` "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Of course, you can also tell your users to put ``'rock_n_roll.apps."
"RockNRollConfig'`` in their :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS` setting. You can even "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The recommended convention is to put the configuration class in a submodule "
"of the application called ``apps``. However, this isn't enforced by Django."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You must include the :attr:`~django.apps.AppConfig.name` attribute for "
"Django to determine which application this configuration applies to. You can "
"define any attributes documented in the :class:`~django.apps.AppConfig` API "
"reference."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If your code imports the application registry in an application's ``__init__."
"py``, the name ``apps`` will clash with the ``apps`` submodule. The best "
"practice is to move that code to a submodule and import it. A workaround is "
"to import the registry under a different name::"

msgstr ""

msgid "Example::"
msgstr "実装例::"

msgid ""
"Although you can access model classes as described above, avoid interacting "
"with the database in your :meth:`ready()` implementation. This includes "
"model methods that execute queries (:meth:`~django.db.models.Model.save()`, :"
"meth:`~django.db.models.Model.delete()`, manager methods etc.), and also raw "
"SQL queries via ``django.db.connection``. Your :meth:`ready()` method will "
"run during startup of every management command. For example, even though the "
"test database configuration is separate from the production settings, "
"``manage.py test`` would still execute some queries against your "
"**production** database!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the usual initialization process, the ``ready`` method is only called "
"once by Django. But in some corner cases, particularly in tests which are "
"fiddling with installed applications, ``ready`` might be called more than "
"once. In that case, either write idempotent methods, or put a flag on your "
"``AppConfig`` classes to prevent re-running code which should be executed "
"exactly one time."
msgstr ""

msgid "Namespace packages as apps"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python packages without an ``__init__.py`` file are known as \"namespace "
"packages\" and may be spread across multiple directories at different "
"locations on ``sys.path`` (see :pep:`420`)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Django applications require a single base filesystem path where Django "
"(depending on configuration) will search for templates, static assets, etc. "
"Thus, namespace packages may only be Django applications if one of the "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :class:`~django.apps.AppConfig` class used to configure the application "

"exactly one dot."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Requires the app registry to be fully populated unless the ``require_ready`` "
"argument is set to ``False``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Setting ``require_ready`` to ``False`` allows looking up models :ref:`while "
"the app registry is being populated <app-loading-process>`, specifically "
"during the second phase where it imports models. Then ``get_model()`` has "
"the same effect as importing the model. The main use case is to configure "
"model classes with settings, such as :setting:`AUTH_USER_MODEL`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When ``require_ready`` is ``False``, ``get_model()`` returns a model class "
"that may not be fully functional (reverse accessors may be missing, for "

msgstr ""

msgid "When running an HTTP server via Django's WSGI support."
msgstr ""

msgid "When invoking a management command."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It must be called explicitly in other cases, for instance in plain Python "
"scripts."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The application registry is initialized in three stages. At each stage, "
"Django processes all applications in the order of :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS`."
msgstr ""

msgid "First Django imports each item in :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If it's an application configuration class, Django imports the root package "
"of the application, defined by its :attr:`~AppConfig.name` attribute. If "
"it's a Python package, Django creates a default application configuration."
msgstr ""

msgid "*At this stage, your code shouldn't import any models!*"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In other words, your applications' root packages and the modules that define "
"your application configuration classes shouldn't import any models, even "
"indirectly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Strictly speaking, Django allows importing models once their application "
"configuration is loaded. However, in order to avoid needless constraints on "
"the order of :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS`, it's strongly recommended not import "
"any models at this stage."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once this stage completes, APIs that operate on application configurations "
"such as :meth:`~apps.get_app_config()` become usable."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then Django attempts to import the ``models`` submodule of each application, "
"if there is one."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You must define or import all models in your application's ``models.py`` or "
"``models/__init__.py``. Otherwise, the application registry may not be fully "
"populated at this point, which could cause the ORM to malfunction."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once this stage completes, APIs that operate on models such as :meth:`~apps."
"get_model()` become usable."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally Django runs the :meth:`~AppConfig.ready()` method of each "
"application configuration."
msgstr ""

msgid "Troubleshooting"
msgstr "トラブルシューティング"

msgid ""
"Here are some common problems that you may encounter during initialization:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":class:`~django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady`: This happens when "
"importing an application configuration or a models module triggers code that "
"depends on the app registry."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, :func:`~django.utils.translation.gettext()` uses the app "
"registry to look up translation catalogs in applications. To translate at "
"import time, you need :func:`~django.utils.translation.gettext_lazy()` "
"instead. (Using :func:`~django.utils.translation.gettext()` would be a bug, "
"because the translation would happen at import time, rather than at each "
"request depending on the active language.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Executing database queries with the ORM at import time in models modules "
"will also trigger this exception. The ORM cannot function properly until all "
"models are available."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This exception also happens if you forget to call :func:`django.setup()` in "
"a standalone Python script."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``ImportError: cannot import name ...`` This happens if the import sequence "
"ends up in a loop."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To eliminate such problems, you should minimize dependencies between your "
"models modules and do as little work as possible at import time. To avoid "
"executing code at import time, you can move it into a function and cache its "
"results. The code will be executed when you first need its results. This "
"concept is known as \"lazy evaluation\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``django.contrib.admin`` automatically performs autodiscovery of ``admin`` "
"modules in installed applications. To prevent it, change your :setting:"
"`INSTALLED_APPS` to contain ``'django.contrib.admin.apps."
"SimpleAdminConfig'`` instead of ``'django.contrib.admin'``."
msgstr ""

msgid "System check framework"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The system check framework is a set of static checks for validating Django "

msgstr ""

msgid "``obj``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Optional. An object providing context for the message (for example, the "

msgid ""
"If you look at any change list in the admin, you'll see this feature in "

"A common use case for admin actions is the bulk updating of a model. Imagine "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A common task we might perform with a model like this is to update an "

"the admin one article at a time, but if we wanted to bulk-publish a group of "
"articles, it'd be tedious. So, let's write an action that lets us change an "
"article's status to \"published.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "Writing action functions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First, we'll need to write a function that gets called when the action is "

"take three arguments:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The current :class:`ModelAdmin`"
msgstr ""

msgid "An :class:`~django.http.HttpRequest` representing the current request,"

msgid ""
"For the best performance, we're using the queryset's :ref:`update method "
"<topics-db-queries-update>`. Other types of actions might need to deal with "
"each object individually; in these cases we'd just iterate over the "
"queryset::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"That's actually all there is to writing an action! However, we'll take one "
"more optional-but-useful step and give the action a \"nice\" title in the "
"admin. By default, this action would appear in the action list as \"Make "
"published\" -- the function name, with underscores replaced by spaces. "
"That's fine, but we can provide a better, more human-friendly name by giving "
"the ``make_published`` function a ``short_description`` attribute::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This might look familiar; the admin's ``list_display`` option uses the same "
"technique to provide human-readable descriptions for callback functions "
"registered there, too."
msgstr ""

msgid "Adding actions to the :class:`ModelAdmin`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Next, we'll need to inform our :class:`ModelAdmin` of the action. This works "
"just like any other configuration option. So, the complete ``admin.py`` with "
"the action and its registration would look like::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"That code will give us an admin change list that looks something like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"That's really all there is to it! If you're itching to write your own "
"actions, you now know enough to get started. The rest of this document just "
"covers more advanced techniques."
msgstr ""

msgid "Handling errors in actions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If there are foreseeable error conditions that may occur while running your "
"action, you should gracefully inform the user of the problem. This means "
"handling exceptions and using :meth:`django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin."
"message_user` to display a user friendly description of the problem in the "
"response."
msgstr ""

msgid "Advanced action techniques"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There's a couple of extra options and possibilities you can exploit for more "
"advanced options."
msgstr ""

msgid "Actions as :class:`ModelAdmin` methods"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The example above shows the ``make_published`` action defined as a simple "
"function. That's perfectly fine, but it's not perfect from a code design "
"point of view: since the action is tightly coupled to the ``Article`` "
"object, it makes sense to hook the action to the ``ArticleAdmin`` object "
"itself."
msgstr ""

msgid "That's easy enough to do::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Notice first that we've moved ``make_published`` into a method and renamed "
"the ``modeladmin`` parameter to ``self``, and second that we've now put the "
"string ``'make_published'`` in ``actions`` instead of a direct function "
"reference. This tells the :class:`ModelAdmin` to look up the action as a "
"method."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Defining actions as methods gives the action more straightforward, idiomatic "
"access to the :class:`ModelAdmin` itself, allowing the action to call any of "
"the methods provided by the admin."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, we can use ``self`` to flash a message to the user informing "
"her that the action was successful::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This make the action match what the admin itself does after successfully "
"performing an action:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Actions that provide intermediate pages"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, after an action is performed the user is simply redirected back "
"to the original change list page. However, some actions, especially more "
"complex ones, will need to return intermediate pages. For example, the built-"
"in delete action asks for confirmation before deleting the selected objects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To provide an intermediary page, simply return an :class:`~django.http."
"HttpResponse` (or subclass) from your action. For example, you might write a "
"simple export function that uses Django's :doc:`serialization functions </"
"topics/serialization>` to dump some selected objects as JSON::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Generally, something like the above isn't considered a great idea. Most of "
"the time, the best practice will be to return an :class:`~django.http."
"HttpResponseRedirect` and redirect the user to a view you've written, "
"passing the list of selected objects in the GET query string. This allows "
"you to provide complex interaction logic on the intermediary pages. For "
"example, if you wanted to provide a more complete export function, you'd "
"want to let the user choose a format, and possibly a list of fields to "
"include in the export. The best thing to do would be to write a small action "
"that simply redirects to your custom export view::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As you can see, the action is the simple part; all the complex logic would "
"belong in your export view. This would need to deal with objects of any "
"type, hence the business with the ``ContentType``."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that when using this technique the :data:`~django.db.models.signals."

"than a many-to-many relation."

msgid ""
"When you specify an intermediary model using the ``through`` argument to a :"

":class:`GEOSGeometry` objects may be created in a few ways.  The first is to "
"simply instantiate the object on some spatial input -- the following are "

msgstr ""

"Another option is to use the constructor for the specific geometry type that "
"you wish to create.  For example, a :class:`Point` object may be created by "
"passing in the X and Y coordinates into its constructor::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All these constructors take the keyword argument ``srid``. For example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, there is the :func:`fromfile` factory method which returns a :class:"
"`GEOSGeometry` object from a file::"
msgstr ""

msgid "My logs are filled with GEOS-related errors"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You find many ``TypeError`` or ``AttributeError`` exceptions filling your "
"Web server's log files. This generally means that you are creating GEOS "
"objects at the top level of some of your Python modules. Then, due to a race "
"condition in the garbage collector, your module is garbage collected before "
"the GEOS object. To prevent this, create :class:`GEOSGeometry` objects "
"inside the local scope of your functions/methods."
msgstr ""

msgid "Geometries are Pythonic"

":class:`GEOSGeometry` objects are 'Pythonic', in other words components may "

"With any geometry object, the :attr:`GEOSGeometry.coords` property may be "
"used to get the geometry coordinates as a Python tuple::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can get/set geometry components using standard Python indexing "
"techniques.  However, what is returned depends on the geometry type of the "
"object.  For example, indexing on a :class:`LineString` returns a coordinate "
"tuple::"

"In addition to the regular :ref:`common-model-field-options` available for "

msgid "Selecting an SRID"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Choosing an appropriate SRID for your model is an important decision that "
"the developer should consider carefully.  The SRID is an integer specifier "
"that corresponds to the projection system that will be used to interpret the "

"context to the coordinates that specify a location.  Although the details of "
"`geodesy`__ are beyond the scope of this documentation, the general problem "
"is that the earth is spherical and representations of the earth (e.g., paper "
"maps, Web maps) are not."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Most people are familiar with using latitude and longitude to reference a "
"location on the earth's surface.  However, latitude and longitude are "
"angles, not distances. In other words, while the shortest path between two "
"points on a flat surface is a straight line, the shortest path between two "
"points on a curved surface (such as the earth) is an *arc* of a `great "
"circle`__. [#fnthematic]_  Thus, additional computation is required to "
"obtain distances in planar units (e.g., kilometers and miles).  Using a "
"geographic coordinate system may introduce complications for the developer "
"later on. For example, SpatiaLite does not have the capability to perform "
"distance calculations between geometries using geographic coordinate "
"systems, e.g. constructing a query to  find all points within 5 miles of a "
"county boundary stored as WGS84. [#fndist]_"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Portions of the earth's surface may projected onto a two-dimensional, or "
"Cartesian, plane.  Projected coordinate systems are especially convenient "
"for region-specific applications, e.g., if you know that your database will "

msgstr ""

msgid "First, invoke the Django shell:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you downloaded the :ref:`worldborders` data earlier in the tutorial, then "
"you can determine its path using Python's built-in ``os`` module::"

"Data source objects can have different layers of geospatial features; "
"however, shapefiles are only allowed to have one layer::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can see the layer's geometry type and how many features it contains::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unfortunately, the shapefile data format does not allow for greater "
"specificity with regards to geometry types.  This shapefile, like many "
"others, actually includes ``MultiPolygon`` geometries, not Polygons. It's "
"important to use a more general field type in models: a GeoDjango "
"``MultiPolygonField`` will accept a ``Polygon`` geometry, but a "
"``PolygonField`` will not accept a ``MultiPolygon`` type geometry.  This is "
"why the ``WorldBorder`` model defined above uses a ``MultiPolygonField``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :class:`~django.contrib.gis.gdal.Layer` may also have a spatial "

msgid ""
"The path to the shapefile is not absolute -- in other words, if you move the "
"``world`` application (with ``data`` subdirectory) to a different location, "
"the script will still work."

"Is posting an arbitrary CSRF token pair (cookie and POST data) a "
"vulnerability?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"No, this is by design. Without a man-in-the-middle attack, there is no way "

msgid ""
"Some security audit tools flag this as a problem but as mentioned before, an "
"attacker cannot steal a user's browser's CSRF cookie. \"Stealing\" or "
"modifying *your own* token using Firebug, Chrome dev tools, etc. isn't a "
"vulnerability."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Is it a problem that Django's CSRF protection isn't linked to a session by "
"default?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"No, this is by design. Not linking CSRF protection to a session allows using "

msgid ""
"For security reasons, CSRF tokens are rotated each time a user logs in. Any "

msgid "Persistent connections"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Persistent connections avoid the overhead of re-establishing a connection to "

"`CONN_MAX_AGE` parameter which defines the maximum lifetime of a connection. "
"It can be set independently for each database."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The default value is ``0``, preserving the historical behavior of closing "

"For unlimited persistent connections, set it to ``None``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Connection management"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Django opens a connection to the database when it first makes a database "
"query. It keeps this connection open and reuses it in subsequent requests. "
"Django closes the connection once it exceeds the maximum age defined by :"
"setting:`CONN_MAX_AGE` or when it isn't usable any longer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In detail, Django automatically opens a connection to the database whenever "
"it needs one and doesn't have one already — either because this is the first "
"connection, or because the previous connection was closed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"At the beginning of each request, Django closes the connection if it has "
"reached its maximum age. If your database terminates idle connections after "
"some time, you should set :setting:`CONN_MAX_AGE` to a lower value, so that "
"Django doesn't attempt to use a connection that has been terminated by the "
"database server. (This problem may only affect very low traffic sites.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"At the end of each request, Django closes the connection if it has reached "
"its maximum age or if it is in an unrecoverable error state. If any database "
"errors have occurred while processing the requests, Django checks whether "
"the connection still works, and closes it if it doesn't. Thus, database "
"errors affect at most one request; if the connection becomes unusable, the "
"next request gets a fresh connection."
msgstr ""

msgid "Caveats"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since each thread maintains its own connection, your database must support "
"at least as many simultaneous connections as you have worker threads."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sometimes a database won't be accessed by the majority of your views, for "
"example because it's the database of an external system, or thanks to "
"caching. In such cases, you should set :setting:`CONN_MAX_AGE` to a low "
"value or even ``0``, because it doesn't make sense to maintain a connection "
"that's unlikely to be reused. This will help keep the number of simultaneous "
"connections to this database small."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The development server creates a new thread for each request it handles, "
"negating the effect of persistent connections. Don't enable them during "
"development."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When Django establishes a connection to the database, it sets up appropriate "
"parameters, depending on the backend being used. If you enable persistent "
"connections, this setup is no longer repeated every request. If you modify "
"parameters such as the connection's isolation level or time zone, you should "
"either restore Django's defaults at the end of each request, force an "
"appropriate value at the beginning of each request, or disable persistent "
"connections."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Whatever value is or was on ``reporter.stories_filed``, Python never gets to "

msgid "You can evaluate a ``QuerySet`` in the following ways:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Iteration.** A ``QuerySet`` is iterable, and it executes its database "
"query the first time you iterate over it. For example, this will print the "
"headline of all entries in the database::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note: Don't use this if all you want to do is determine if at least one "
"result exists. It's more efficient to use :meth:`~QuerySet.exists`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Slicing.** As explained in :ref:`limiting-querysets`, a ``QuerySet`` can "
"be sliced, using Python's array-slicing syntax. Slicing an unevaluated "
"``QuerySet`` usually returns another unevaluated ``QuerySet``, but Django "
"will execute the database query if you use the \"step\" parameter of slice "
"syntax, and will return a list. Slicing a ``QuerySet`` that has been "
"evaluated also returns a list."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Also note that even though slicing an unevaluated ``QuerySet`` returns "
"another unevaluated ``QuerySet``, modifying it further (e.g., adding more "
"filters, or modifying ordering) is not allowed, since that does not "
"translate well into SQL and it would not have a clear meaning either."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Pickling/Caching.** See the following section for details of what is "
"involved when `pickling QuerySets`_. The important thing for the purposes of "
"this section is that the results are read from the database."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**repr().** A ``QuerySet`` is evaluated when you call ``repr()`` on it. This "
"is for convenience in the Python interactive interpreter, so you can "
"immediately see your results when using the API interactively."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**len().** A ``QuerySet`` is evaluated when you call ``len()`` on it. This, "
"as you might expect, returns the length of the result list."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note: If you only need to determine the number of records in the set (and "
"don't need the actual objects), it's much more efficient to handle a count "
"at the database level using SQL's ``SELECT COUNT(*)``. Django provides a :"
"meth:`~QuerySet.count` method for precisely this reason."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**list().** Force evaluation of a ``QuerySet`` by calling ``list()`` on it. "
"For example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**bool().** Testing a ``QuerySet`` in a boolean context, such as using "
"``bool()``, ``or``, ``and`` or an ``if`` statement, will cause the query to "
"be executed. If there is at least one result, the ``QuerySet`` is ``True``, "

msgid "Pickling ``QuerySet``\\s"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you :mod:`pickle` a ``QuerySet``, this will force all the results to be "

"precursor to caching and when the cached queryset is reloaded, you want the "
"results to already be present and ready for use (reading from the database "
"can take some time, defeating the purpose of caching). This means that when "
"you unpickle a ``QuerySet``, it contains the results at the moment it was "
"pickled, rather than the results that are currently in the database."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you only want to pickle the necessary information to recreate the "

"attribute of the ``QuerySet``. You can then recreate the original "
"``QuerySet`` (without any results loaded) using some code like this::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``query`` attribute is an opaque object. It represents the internals of "
"the query construction and is not part of the public API. However, it is "
"safe (and fully supported) to pickle and unpickle the attribute's contents "
"as described here."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Pickles of ``QuerySets`` are only valid for the version of Django that was "

"ション共通のナビゲーションなど) に項目を追加するのが容易になります。"

msgid "Here are some tips for working with inheritance:"
msgstr "継承を使用する際のコツをいくつか紹介します:"

msgid ""
"If you use :ttag:`{% extends %}<extends>` in a template, it must be the "
"first template tag in that template. Template inheritance won't work, "
"otherwise."
msgstr ""
"テンプレート内で :ttag:`{% extends %}<extends>` を使用する際は、その点プレー"
"ト内で一番最初のテンプレートタグとして指定する必要があります。それ以外の場"
"合、継承が正しく動作しません。"

msgid ""
"More :ttag:`{% block %}<block>` tags in your base templates are better. "
"Remember, child templates don't have to define all parent blocks, so you can "
"fill in reasonable defaults in a number of blocks, then only define the ones "
"you need later. It's better to have more hooks than fewer hooks."
msgstr ""
"ベースのテンプレートには :ttag:`{% block %}<block>` タグを多く配置するほどよ"
"いです。子テンプレートがすべてのブロックを埋める必要がないことを思い出してく"
"ださい。多くのブロック内に適当なデフォルトを記述しておき、必要なものを後で定"
"義し直せばいいのです。フックは多ければ多いほどいいということです。"

msgid ""
"If you find yourself duplicating content in a number of templates, it "
"probably means you should move that content to a ``{% block %}`` in a parent "
"template."
msgstr ""
"もし同じコンテンツを複数のテンプレート内で記述していたら、そのコンテンツを親"
"テンプレートの ``{% block %}`` に移動させるべきかもしれません。"

msgid ""
"If you need to get the content of the block from the parent template, the "
"``{{ block.super }}`` variable will do the trick. This is useful if you want "
"to add to the contents of a parent block instead of completely overriding "
"it. Data inserted using ``{{ block.super }}`` will not be automatically "
"escaped (see the `next section`_), since it was already escaped, if "
"necessary, in the parent template."
msgstr ""
"親テンプレートからブロックのコンテンツを取得する必要がある場合、``{{ block."
"super }}`` が利用できます。親のブロックを完全にオーバーライドせずに、コンテン"
"ツを追加したい場合に有用です。``{{ block.super }}`` を使って挿入されたデータ"
"は自動的にエスケープされません (`next section`_ を参照してください)。これは、"
"必要な場合は親テンプレートですでにエスケープされているからです。"

msgid ""
"Variables created outside of a :ttag:`{% block %}<block>` using the template "
"tag ``as`` syntax can't be used inside the block. For example, this template "
"doesn't render anything::"
msgstr ""
"テンプレートタグの ``as`` シンタックスを使用して :ttag:`{% block %}<block>` "
"の外で生成された変数は、ブロックの内部で使用することはできません。例えば、以"

"For extra readability, you can optionally give a *name* to your ``{% "
"endblock %}`` tag. For example::"
msgstr ""
"可読性を増すために、``{% endblock %}`` タグにも *名前* を記述できます。例え"
"ば:"

msgid ""
"In larger templates, this technique helps you see which ``{% block %}`` tags "
"are being closed."
msgstr ""
"大きなテンプレートでは、このテクニックでどの ``{% block %}`` が閉じられている"
"のかが分かりやすくなります。"

msgid ""
"Finally, note that you can't define multiple :ttag:`block` tags with the "
"same name in the same template. This limitation exists because a block tag "
"works in \"both\" directions. That is, a block tag doesn't just provide a "
"hole to fill -- it also defines the content that fills the hole in the "
"*parent*. If there were two similarly-named :ttag:`block` tags in a "
"template, that template's parent wouldn't know which one of the blocks' "
"content to use."
msgstr ""
"最後に、同じテンプレート内で同じ名前の :ttag:`block` タグを複数定義することは"
"できないことに留意してください。この制限は、block タグが \"両方向に\" 働くの"
"が理由です。block タグは埋めるための穴を提供するだけではなく -- *親テンプレー"
"ト* 内で穴を埋めるコンテンツを定義します。もし同名の :ttag:`block` がテンプ"

"need to tell Django what encoding your database uses: that is handled "
"transparently."

msgid "General string handling"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Whenever you use strings with Django -- e.g., in database lookups, template "
"rendering or anywhere else -- you have two choices for encoding those "
"strings. You can use normal strings or bytestrings (starting with a 'b')."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A bytestring does not carry any information with it about its encoding. For "
"that reason, we have to make an assumption, and Django assumes that all "
"bytestrings are in UTF-8."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you pass a string to Django that has been encoded in some other format, "
"things will go wrong in interesting ways. Usually, Django will raise a "
"``UnicodeDecodeError`` at some point."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If your code only uses ASCII data, it's safe to use your normal strings, "
"passing them around at will, because ASCII is a subset of UTF-8."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Don't be fooled into thinking that if your :setting:`DEFAULT_CHARSET` "
"setting is set to something other than ``'utf-8'`` you can use that other "
"encoding in your bytestrings! :setting:`DEFAULT_CHARSET` only applies to the "
"strings generated as the result of template rendering (and email). Django "
"will always assume UTF-8 encoding for internal bytestrings. The reason for "
"this is that the :setting:`DEFAULT_CHARSET` setting is not actually under "
"your control (if you are the application developer). It's under the control "
"of the person installing and using your application -- and if that person "
"chooses a different setting, your code must still continue to work. Ergo, it "
"cannot rely on that setting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In most cases when Django is dealing with strings, it will convert them to "
"strings before doing anything else. So, as a general rule, if you pass in a "
"bytestring, be prepared to receive a string back in the result."
msgstr ""

msgid "Translated strings"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Aside from strings and bytestrings, there's a third type of string-like "
"object you may encounter when using Django. The framework's "
"internationalization features introduce the concept of a \"lazy translation"
"\" -- a string that has been marked as translated but whose actual "
"translation result isn't determined until the object is used in a string. "
"This feature is useful in cases where the translation locale is unknown "
"until the string is used, even though the string might have originally been "
"created when the code was first imported."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Normally, you won't have to worry about lazy translations. Just be aware "
"that if you examine an object and it claims to be a ``django.utils."
"functional.__proxy__`` object, it is a lazy translation. Calling ``str()`` "
"with the lazy translation as the argument will generate a string in the "
"current locale."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For more details about lazy translation objects, refer to the :doc:"
"`internationalization </topics/i18n/index>` documentation."
msgstr ""

msgid "Useful utility functions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Because some string operations come up again and again, Django ships with a "
"few useful functions that should make working with string and bytestring "
"objects a bit easier."
msgstr ""

msgid "Conversion functions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``django.utils.encoding`` module contains a few functions that are handy "
"for converting back and forth between strings and bytestrings."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``smart_text(s, encoding='utf-8', strings_only=False, errors='strict')`` "
"converts its input to a string. The ``encoding`` parameter specifies the "
"input encoding. (For example, Django uses this internally when processing "
"form input data, which might not be UTF-8 encoded.) The ``strings_only`` "
"parameter, if set to True, will result in Python numbers, booleans and "
"``None`` not being converted to a string (they keep their original types). "
"The ``errors`` parameter takes any of the values that are accepted by "
"Python's ``str()`` function for its error handling."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``force_text(s, encoding='utf-8', strings_only=False, errors='strict')`` is "
"identical to ``smart_text()`` in almost all cases. The difference is when "
"the first argument is a :ref:`lazy translation <lazy-translations>` "
"instance. While ``smart_text()`` preserves lazy translations, "
"``force_text()`` forces those objects to a string (causing the translation "
"to occur). Normally, you'll want to use ``smart_text()``. However, "
"``force_text()`` is useful in template tags and filters that absolutely "
"*must* have a string to work with, not just something that can be converted "
"to a string."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``smart_bytes(s, encoding='utf-8', strings_only=False, errors='strict')`` is "
"essentially the opposite of ``smart_text()``. It forces the first argument "
"to a bytestring. The ``strings_only`` parameter has the same behavior as for "
"``smart_text()`` and ``force_text()``. This is slightly different semantics "
"from Python's builtin ``str()`` function, but the difference is needed in a "
"few places within Django's internals."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Normally, you'll only need to use ``force_text()``. Call it as early as "
"possible on any input data that might be either a string or a bytestring, "
"and from then on, you can treat the result as always being a string."
msgstr ""

msgid "URI and IRI handling"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Web frameworks have to deal with URLs (which are a type of IRI_). One "
"requirement of URLs is that they are encoded using only ASCII characters. "
"However, in an international environment, you might need to construct a URL "
"from an IRI_ -- very loosely speaking, a URI_ that can contain Unicode "
"characters. Use these functions for quoting and converting an IRI to a URI:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :func:`django.utils.encoding.iri_to_uri()` function, which implements "
"the conversion from IRI to URI as required by :rfc:`3987#section-3.1`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :func:`urllib.parse.quote` and :func:`urllib.parse.quote_plus` functions "
"from Python's standard library."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These two groups of functions have slightly different purposes, and it's "
"important to keep them straight. Normally, you would use ``quote()`` on the "
"individual portions of the IRI or URI path so that any reserved characters "
"such as '&' or '%' are correctly encoded. Then, you apply ``iri_to_uri()`` "
"to the full IRI and it converts any non-ASCII characters to the correct "
"encoded values."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Technically, it isn't correct to say that ``iri_to_uri()`` implements the "
"full algorithm in the IRI specification. It doesn't (yet) perform the "
"international domain name encoding portion of the algorithm."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``iri_to_uri()`` function will not change ASCII characters that are "
"otherwise permitted in a URL. So, for example, the character '%' is not "
"further encoded when passed to ``iri_to_uri()``. This means you can pass a "
"full URL to this function and it will not mess up the query string or "
"anything like that."
msgstr ""

msgid "An example might clarify things here::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you look carefully, you can see that the portion that was generated by "
"``quote()`` in the second example was not double-quoted when passed to "
"``iri_to_uri()``. This is a very important and useful feature. It means that "
"you can construct your IRI without worrying about whether it contains non-"
"ASCII characters and then, right at the end, call ``iri_to_uri()`` on the "
"result."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Similarly, Django provides :func:`django.utils.encoding.uri_to_iri()` which "
"implements the conversion from URI to IRI as per :rfc:`3987#section-3.2`."
msgstr ""

msgid "An example to demonstrate::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the first example, the UTF-8 characters are unquoted. In the second, the "
"percent-encodings remain unchanged because they lie outside the valid UTF-8 "
"range or represent a reserved character."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Both ``iri_to_uri()`` and ``uri_to_iri()`` functions are idempotent, which "
"means the following is always true::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"So you can safely call it multiple times on the same URI/IRI without risking "
"double-quoting problems."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Because all strings are returned from the database as ``str`` objects, model "
"fields that are character based (CharField, TextField, URLField, etc.) will "
"contain Unicode values when Django retrieves data from the database. This is "
"*always* the case, even if the data could fit into an ASCII bytestring."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can pass in bytestrings when creating a model or populating a field, and "
"Django will convert it to strings when it needs to."
msgstr ""

msgid "Taking care in ``get_absolute_url()``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"URLs can only contain ASCII characters. If you're constructing a URL from "
"pieces of data that might be non-ASCII, be careful to encode the results in "
"a way that is suitable for a URL. The :func:`~django.urls.reverse` function "
"handles this for you automatically."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you're constructing a URL manually (i.e., *not* using the ``reverse()`` "
"function), you'll need to take care of the encoding yourself. In this case, "
"use the ``iri_to_uri()`` and ``quote()`` functions that were documented "
"above_. For example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function returns a correctly encoded URL even if ``self.location`` is "
"something like \"Jack visited Paris & Orléans\". (In fact, the "
"``iri_to_uri()`` call isn't strictly necessary in the above example, because "
"all the non-ASCII characters would have been removed in quoting in the first "
"line.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Use strings when creating templates manually::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"But the common case is to read templates from the filesystem, and this "
"creates a slight complication: not all filesystems store their data encoded "
"as UTF-8. If your template files are not stored with a UTF-8 encoding, set "
"the :setting:`FILE_CHARSET` setting to the encoding of the files on disk. "
"When Django reads in a template file, it will convert the data from this "
"encoding to Unicode. (:setting:`FILE_CHARSET` is set to ``'utf-8'`` by "
"default.)"

msgid "Template tags and filters"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A couple of tips to remember when writing your own template tags and filters:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Always return strings from a template tag's ``render()`` method and from "
"template filters."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use ``force_text()`` in preference to ``smart_text()`` in these places. Tag "
"rendering and filter calls occur as the template is being rendered, so there "
"is no advantage to postponing the conversion of lazy translation objects "
"into strings. It's easier to work solely with strings at that point."
msgstr ""

msgid "Files"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you intend to allow users to upload files, you must ensure that the "

"Django adopts a \"lazy\" approach to decoding form data. The data in an "

"``HttpRequest.POST`` data structures have any decoding applied to them. "
"Those two fields will return their members as Unicode data. All other "
"attributes and methods of ``HttpRequest`` return data exactly as it was "
"submitted by the client."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, the :setting:`DEFAULT_CHARSET` setting is used as the assumed "

"you can set the ``encoding`` attribute on an ``HttpRequest`` instance. For "
"example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can even change the encoding after having accessed ``request.GET`` or "

"Most developers won't need to worry about changing form encoding, but this "
"is a useful feature for applications that talk to legacy systems whose "
