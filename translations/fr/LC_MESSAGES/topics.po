"The other difference that is more important for proxy models, is how model "

Le code reste en mémoire tout au long du cycle de vie du processus Apache, ce qui apporte des améliorations de performance significatives en comparaison d'autres configurations. En mode démon, mod_wsgi délègue la gestion des requêtes à un processus démon indépendant. Ce processus peut fonctionner sous un nom d'utilisateur différent de celui du serveur Web, ce qui peut améliorer la sécurité ; d'autre part, le processus peut être redémarré sans devoir redémarrer tout le serveur Web Apache, ce qui peut simplifier la mise à jour de code. Consultez la documentation de mod_wsgi pour déterminer le mode qui vous conviendra le mieux. Assurez-vous que Apache est installé et que son module mod_wsgi est activé.
