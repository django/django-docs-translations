"contains lots of great information and is a must read for anyone who'd like "
"to become a regular contributor to Django. If you've got questions, it's "
"probably got the answers."
msgstr ""
"一旦你完成了这份教程，你可以浏览 :doc:`Django 贡献文档 </internals/"
"contributing/index>` 的剩余部分。它包含了大量信息。任何想成为 Django 的正式贡"
"献者的人都必须阅读它。如果你有问题，它也许会给你答案。"

msgid "Python 3 required!"
msgstr "必须Python 3！"

msgid ""
"The current version of Django doesn't support Python 2.7. Get Python 3 at "

"目前的 Django 版本不再支持 Python 2.7。你可以在 `Python 下载页 <https://www."
"python.org/downloads/>`_ 或通过操作系统的包管理器下载 Python 3。"

msgid "For Windows users"
msgstr "对于 Windows 用户"

msgid ""
"When installing Python on Windows, make sure you check the option \"Add "
"python.exe to Path\", so that it is always available on the command line."
msgstr ""
"在Windows上安装 Python 时，确保勾选在环境变量path中“添加 python.exe 的路径”，"
"这样才可以让它在命令行下总是可用。"

msgid "Code of Conduct"

msgid "Installing Git"
msgstr "安装Git"

msgid ""
"For this tutorial, you'll need Git installed to download the current "
"development version of Django and to generate patch files for the changes "
"you make."
msgstr ""
"在本教程中，你需要安装好 Git，用 Git 下载 Django 的最新开发版本并且为你的修改"
"生成补丁文件。"

msgid ""
"To check whether or not you have Git installed, enter ``git`` into the "
"command line. If you get messages saying that this command could not be "
"found, you'll have to download and install it, see `Git's download page`__."
msgstr ""
"要检查你是否已经安装 Git，命令行输入 ``git``。如果提示这个命令无法找到，你必"

"的使用方法 (确保已安装) "

msgid "Getting a copy of Django's development version"
msgstr "获得一个 Django 开发版本的副本"

msgid ""
"The first step to contributing to Django is to get a copy of the source "
"code. First, `fork Django on GitHub <https://github.com/django/django/"
"fork>`__. Then, from the command line, use the ``cd`` command to navigate to "
"the directory where you'll want your local copy of Django to live."
msgstr ""
"为 Django 做贡献的第一步就是获取源代码副本。首先， `fork Github 上的 Django "
"项目 <https://github.com/django/django/fork>`。接下来，在命令行中，使用 "
"``cd`` 命令切换至某个你想存放 Django 源码的目录。"

msgid "Download the Django source code repository using the following command:"
msgstr "使用下面的命令来下载 Django 的源码库："

msgid "Low bandwidth connection?"
msgstr "低速宽带连接？"

msgid ""
"You can add the ``--depth 1`` argument to ``git clone`` to skip downloading "
"all of Django's commit history, which reduces data transfer from  ~250 MB to "
"~70 MB."
msgstr ""
"你可以在用命令 ``git clone`` 下载仓库的时候加上参数 ``--depth 1`` 来跳过 "
"Django 的提交历史，这大约能把下载大小从250MB减少到70MB"

msgid ""
"Now that you have a local copy of Django, you can install it just like you "
"would install any package using ``pip``. The most convenient way to do so is "
"by using a *virtual environment*, which is a feature built into Python that "
"allows you to keep a separate directory of installed packages for each of "
"your projects so that they don't interfere with each other."
msgstr ""
"你现在已经将Django拷贝到本地，可以像安装其他软件包一样使用 ``pip``进行安装。 "
"最便捷的方式是通过  *virtual environment*， 这是 Python 的一个内置特性，它可"
"以让你在一个目录中保持独立的软件包环境而不影响其他的项目。"

msgid ""
"It's a good idea to keep all your virtual environments in one place, for "
"example in ``.virtualenvs/`` in your home directory."
msgstr ""
"将你的虚拟环境都放在一个位置是明智的做法，例如将它们放置在你主目录下的 ``."
"virtualenvs/`` 中。"

msgid "Create a new virtual environment by running:"
msgstr "通过运行以下命令创建一个虚拟环境："

msgid "The path is where the new environment will be saved on your computer."
msgstr "该路径就是保存这个新的虚拟运行环境的地方。"

msgid ""
"The final step in setting up your virtual environment is to activate it:"
msgstr "设置虚拟环境的最后一步是激活它；"

msgid ""
"If the ``source`` command is not available, you can try using a dot instead:"
msgstr "如果 ``source`` 命令不可用，你可以试试："

msgid "To activate your virtual environment on Windows, run:"
msgstr "在Windows下采用如下命令进行激活虚拟环境："

msgid ""
"You have to activate the virtual environment whenever you open a new "
"terminal window. virtualenvwrapper__ is a useful tool for making this more "
"convenient."
msgstr ""
"每当你开启一个新的终端时，你都需要激活虚拟环境。 virtualenvwrapper__ 可以使其"
"更便捷。"

msgid ""
"The name of the currently activated virtual environment is displayed on the "
"command line to help you keep track of which one you are using. Anything you "
"install through ``pip`` while this name is displayed will be installed in "
"that virtual environment, isolated from other environments and system-wide "
"packages."
msgstr ""
"当前激活的虚拟环境的名称会被展示在命令行，这可以让你搞清楚你正在使用哪一个虚"
"拟环境。你通过 ``pip`` 安装的任何软件包如果在安装时显示了该名称，则都会被安装"
"到该虚拟环境中，而且这些软件包不会影响到其他虚拟环境，也不会与其他系统级的软"
"件包发生冲突。"

msgid "Go ahead and install the previously cloned copy of Django:"
msgstr "下一步安装之前克隆的 Django 副本："

msgid ""
"The installed version of Django is now pointing at your local copy. You will "
"immediately see any changes you make to it, which is of great help when "
"writing your first patch."
msgstr ""
"现在安装的 Django 版本就是你本地副本的版本。你将立刻见到任何你对它的修改，这"
"对你编写第一个补丁很有帮助。"

msgid "Running Django's test suite for the first time"
msgstr "首先运行 Django 的测试套件"

msgid ""
"When contributing to Django it's very important that your code changes don't "
"introduce bugs into other areas of Django. One way to check that Django "
"still works after you make your changes is by running Django's test suite. "
"If all the tests still pass, then you can be reasonably sure that your "
"changes work and haven't broken other parts Django. If you've never run "
"Django's test suite before, it's a good idea to run it once beforehand to "
"get familiar with its output."
msgstr ""
"当你贡献代码给 Django 的时候，你修改的代码千万不要给其它部分引入新的 bug。 有"
"个办法可以在你更改代码之后检查 Django 是否能正常工作，就是运行 Django 的测试"
"套件。如果所有的测试用例都通过，你就有理由相信你的改动完全没有破坏 Django。如"
"果你从来没有运行过 Django 的测试套件，那么比较好的做法是事先运行一遍，熟悉下"
"正常情况下应该输出什么结果。"

msgid ""
"Before running the test suite, install its dependencies by ``cd``-ing into "
"the Django ``tests/`` directory and then running:"
msgstr ""
"运行测试套件之前，先 ``cd`` 进入 Django 的 ``test/`` 目录，安装其依赖，运行："

msgid ""
"If you encounter an error during the installation, your system might be "
"missing a dependency for one or more of the Python packages. Consult the "
"failing package's documentation or search the Web with the error message "
"that you encounter."
msgstr ""
"如果安装过程中发生了错误，可能是你的系统缺少一个或多个 Python 依赖包。请参考"
"安装失败的包的文档或者在网上搜索提示的错误信息。"

msgid ""
"Now we are ready to run the test suite. If you're using GNU/Linux, macOS, or "
"some other flavor of Unix, run:"
msgstr ""
"现在你可以运行测试套件。如果你用的是 GNU/Linux， macOS 或者其它类 Unix 系统，"
"运行："

msgid ""
"Now sit back and relax. Django's entire test suite has thousands of tests, "
"and it takes at least a few minutes run, depending on the speed of your "
"computer."
msgstr ""
"现在坐下来放松一下。Django 完整的测试套件有成千上万种不同的测试，所以它至少需"
"要运行几分钟，这个时间取决于你的电脑的速度。 "

msgid ""
"While Django's test suite is running, you'll see a stream of characters "
"representing the status of each test as it completes. ``E`` indicates that "
"an error was raised during a test, and ``F`` indicates that a test's "
"assertions failed. Both of these are considered to be test failures. "
"Meanwhile, ``x`` and ``s`` indicated expected failures and skipped tests, "
"respectively. Dots indicate passing tests."
msgstr ""
"当Django的测试套件被执行时，您将看到一个代表测试运行状态的字符流。 其中字符 "
"``E`` 表示测试中出现异常， ``F`` 表示测试中的一个断言失败，这两种情况都被认为"
"测试结果失败。而 ``x`` 和 ``s`` 分别表示与期望结果不同和跳过测试，逗点则表示"
"测试被通过了。 "

msgid ""
"Skipped tests are typically due to missing external libraries required to "
"run the test; see :ref:`running-unit-tests-dependencies` for a list of "
"dependencies and be sure to install any for tests related to the changes you "
"are making (we won't need any for this tutorial). Some tests are specific to "
"a particular database backend and will be skipped if not testing with that "
"backend. SQLite is the database backend for the default settings. To run the "
"tests using a different backend, see :ref:`running-unit-tests-settings`."
msgstr ""
"缺失外部依赖库通常会导致测试被跳过；查看 :ref:`running-unit-tests-"
"dependencies` 获取依赖库列表，如果你修改了测试代码，请同时安装相关依赖库（本"
"教程无需额外依赖库）。某些测试使用了特定的数据库后端，如果当前测试设置并未使"
"用此数据库后端，那么这些相关的测试也会被跳过。SQLite 是默认的数据库后端。如果"
"想使用其他后端进行测试，查看 :ref:`running-unit-tests-settings`。"

msgid ""
"Once the tests complete, you should be greeted with a message informing you "
"whether the test suite passed or failed. Since you haven't yet made any "
"changes to Django's code, the entire test suite **should** pass. If you get "
"failures or errors make sure you've followed all of the previous steps "
"properly. See :ref:`running-unit-tests` for more information."
msgstr ""
"代码测试集当测试执行完毕后，得到反馈信息显示测试已通过，或者测试失败。 因为还"
"没有对 Django 的代码做任何修改, 所有的测试集 **应该** 测试通过. 如果测试失败"
"或出现错误，回头确认以上执行操作是否正确. 查看 :ref:`running-unit-tests` 获取"
"更多信息。"

msgid ""
"Note that the latest Django master may not always be stable. When developing "
"against master, you can check `Django's continuous integration builds`__ to "
"determine if the failures are specific to your machine or if they are also "
"present in Django's official builds. If you click to view a particular "
"build, you can view the \"Configuration Matrix\" which shows failures broken "
"down by Python version and database backend."
msgstr ""
"注意最新版本 Django 分支不总是稳定的。当在分支上开发时，你可以查看代码持续集"
"成构建页面的信息 来判断测试错误只在你指定的电脑上发生，还是官方版本中也存在该"
"错误。如果点击某个构建信息，可以通过 \"Configuration Matrix\" 查看错误发生时 "
"Python 以及后端数据库的信息。"

msgid ""
"For this tutorial and the ticket we're working on, testing against SQLite is "
"sufficient, however, it's possible (and sometimes necessary) to :ref:`run "
"the tests using a different database <running-unit-tests-settings>`."
msgstr ""
"在本教程以及处理工单所用分支中，测试使用数据库 SQLite 即可，然而在某些情况下"
"需要（有时需要） ，参考 :ref:`run the tests using a different database `。"

msgid "Working on a feature"
msgstr "尝试搞定一项新功能"

msgid ""
"For this tutorial, we'll work on a \"fake ticket\" as a case study. Here are "

msgstr "为你的补丁创建一个分支"

msgid "Before making any changes, create a new branch for the ticket:"
msgstr "在做出任何修改之前，为你的工单创建一个分支："

msgid ""
"You can choose any name that you want for the branch, \"ticket_99999\" is an "

"有更改，将只会针对该分支即ticket_99999产生影响，而不会影响到我们早先克隆的原"
"始代码。"

msgid "Writing some tests for your ticket"
msgstr "为你的工单写一些测试用例"

msgid ""
"In most cases, for a patch to be accepted into Django it has to include "
"tests. For bug fix patches, this means writing a regression test to ensure "
"that the bug is never reintroduced into Django later on. A regression test "
"should be written in such a way that it will fail while the bug still exists "
"and pass once the bug has been fixed. For patches containing new features, "
"you'll need to include tests which ensure that the new features are working "
"correctly. They too should fail when the new feature is not present, and "
"then pass once it has been implemented."
msgstr ""
"大多数情况下，Django 的补丁必需包含测试。Bug 修复补丁的测试是一个回归测试，确"
"保该 Bug 不会再次在 Django 中出现。该测试应该在 Bug 存在时测试失败，在 Bug 已"
"经修复后通过测试。新功能补丁的测试必须验证新功能是否正常运行。新功能的测试将"
"在功能正常时通过测试，功能未执行时测试失败。"

msgid ""
"A good way to do this is to write your new tests first, before making any "
"changes to the code. This style of development is called `test-driven "
"development`__ and can be applied to both entire projects and single "
"patches. After writing your tests, you then run them to make sure that they "
"do indeed fail (since you haven't fixed that bug or added that feature yet). "
"If your new tests don't fail, you'll need to fix them so that they do. After "
"all, a regression test that passes regardless of whether a bug is present is "
"not very helpful at preventing that bug from reoccurring down the road."
msgstr ""
"最好的方式是在修改代码之前写测试单元代码。这种开发风格叫做 `test-driven "
"development`__ 被应用在项目开发和单一补丁开发过程中。单元测试编写完毕后，执行"
"单元测试，此时测试失败（因为目前还没有修复 bug 或添加新功能），如果测试成功通"
