msgid ""
"Make sure the feature actually requires changes in Django's core. If your "

msgid ""
"First request the feature on the |django-developers| list, not in the ticket "
"tracker. It'll get read more closely if it's on the mailing list. This is "
"even more important for large-scale feature requests. We like to discuss any "
"big changes to Django's core on the mailing list before actually working on "
"them."
msgstr ""
"首先请求| django-developers |列表上的功能，而不是在工单跟踪。 如果它在邮件列"
"表中，将会得到更仔细地阅读。 这对于大规模功能请求来说更为重要。 在实际操作之"
"前，我们倾向在邮件列表上讨论Django核心的任何重大变化。"

"Describe clearly and concisely what the missing feature is and how you'd "

"developers| 的讨论链接。"

msgid ""
"As with most open-source projects, code talks. If you are willing to write "

"it, it's much more likely to be accepted. Fork Django on GitHub, create a "
"feature branch, and show us your work!"
msgstr ""

msgstr "另请参阅：：ref：`documenting-new-features`。"

msgid "How we make decisions"
msgstr "我们如何作出决定"

msgid ""
"Whenever possible, we strive for a rough consensus. To that end, we'll often "
"have informal votes on |django-developers| or the Django Forum about a "
"feature. In these votes we follow the voting style invented by Apache and "
"used on Python itself, where votes are given as +1, +0, -0, or -1. Roughly "
"translated, these votes mean:"
msgstr ""

msgid "+1: \"I love the idea and I'm strongly committed to it.\""
msgstr "+1: \"我喜欢这个想法，强烈支持。\""

msgid "+0: \"Sounds OK to me.\""
msgstr "+0: \"看起来没问题。\""

msgid "-0: \"I'm not thrilled, but I won't stand in the way.\""

msgid ""
"-1: \"I strongly disagree and would be very unhappy to see the idea turn "
"into reality.\""
msgstr "-1: \"我强烈反对。如果这个想法变成了现实，我会很不高兴。\""

msgid ""
"Although these votes are informal, they'll be taken very seriously. After a "
"suitable voting period, if an obvious consensus arises we'll follow the "
"votes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, consensus is not always possible. If consensus cannot be reached, "
"or if the discussion toward a consensus fizzles out without a concrete "
"decision, the decision may be deferred to the :ref:`steering council "
"<steering-council>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Internally, the steering council will use the same voting mechanism. A "
"proposition will be considered carried if:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are at least three \"+1\" votes from members of the steering council."
msgstr ""

msgid "There is no \"-1\" vote from any member of the steering council."
msgstr ""

msgid "Votes should be submitted within a week."
msgstr "投票应该在一周内提交。"

msgid ""
"Since this process allows any steering council member to veto a proposal, a "
"\"-1\" vote should be accompanied by an explanation of what it would take to "
"convert that \"-1\" into at least a \"+0\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Votes on technical matters should be announced and held in public on the |"
"django-developers| mailing list or on the Django Forum."
msgstr ""

msgid "Committing code"
msgstr "提交代码"

msgid ""
"This section is addressed to the mergers and to anyone interested in knowing "

msgstr ""

msgid "Handling pull requests"
msgstr "处理 pull 请求"

msgid ""
"Since Django is hosted on GitHub, patches are provided in the form of pull "
"requests."
msgstr ""
"因为Django现在是托管在GitHub上的，所以大多数补丁都是以 pull requests 的形式提"
"供的。 "

msgid ""
"When committing a pull request, make sure each individual commit matches the "
"commit guidelines described below. Contributors are expected to provide the "
"best pull requests possible. In practice mergers - who will likely be more "
"familiar with the commit guidelines - may decide to bring a commit up to "
"standard themselves."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You may want to have Jenkins or GitHub actions test the pull request with "
"one of the pull request builders that doesn't run automatically, such as "
"Oracle or Selenium. See the `CI wiki page`_ for instructions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you find yourself checking out pull requests locally more often, this git "
"alias will be helpful:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Add it to your ``~/.gitconfig``, and set ``upstream`` to be ``django/"
"django``. Then you can run ``git pr ####`` to checkout the corresponding "
"pull request."
msgstr ""
"将它添加到你的 ``~/.gitconfig`` 文件中，并且把 ``upstream`` 改为 ``django/"
"django`` 。然后你就可以通过运行 ``git pr ####`` 来检出对应的 pull request "
"了。"

msgid ""
"At this point, you can work on the code. Use ``git rebase -i`` and ``git "
"commit --amend`` to make sure the commits have the expected level of "
"quality. Once you're ready:"
msgstr ""
"到了这个阶段,你可以着手于代码.使用\"git rebase -i\"和\"git commit --ammend\" "
"来确保你的提交准确无误. 一旦你准备好了:"

msgid ""
"Force push to the branch after rebasing on main but before merging and "
"pushing to upstream. This allows the commit hashes on main and the branch to "
"match which automatically closes the pull request."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a pull request doesn't need to be merged as multiple commits, you can use "
"GitHub's \"Squash and merge\" button on the website. Edit the commit message "
"as needed to conform to :ref:`the guidelines <committing-guidelines>` and "
"remove the pull request number that's automatically appended to the "
"message's first line."
msgstr ""
"如果拉请求不需要合并为多个提交，则可以在网页上使用Github的“挤压和合并”按钮。"
"根据需要编辑提交消息以符合：ref:`The guidelines<committing-guidelines>`并删除"
"自动附加到消息第一行的请求编号。"

msgid ""
"When rewriting the commit history of a pull request, the goal is to make "
"Django's commit history as usable as possible:"
msgstr "当重写pull请求的提交历史时，目标是使Django的提交历史尽可能可用："

msgid ""
"If a patch contains back-and-forth commits, then rewrite those into one. For "
"example, if a commit adds some code and a second commit fixes stylistic "
"issues introduced in the first commit, those commits should be squashed "
"before merging."
msgstr ""
"如果补丁包含来回提交，则将其重写为一个。例如，如果提交添加了一些代码，第二个"
"提交修复了第一次提交中引入的样式问题，那么这些提交应该在合并之前被压缩。"

msgid ""
"Separate changes to different commits by logical grouping: if you do a "
"stylistic cleanup at the same time as you do other changes to a file, "
"separating the changes into two different commits will make reviewing "
"history easier."
msgstr ""
"通过逻辑分组对不同提交进行单独更改：如果在对文件进行其他更改的同时进行样式清"
"理，则将更改分成两个不同的提交将使查看历史记录变得更容易。"

msgid "Beware of merges of upstream branches in the pull requests."
msgstr "注意拉取请求中上游分支的合并。"

msgid ""
"Tests should pass and docs should build after each commit. Neither the tests "
"nor the docs should emit warnings."
msgstr "测试应该通过，文档应该在每次提交后构建。测试和文档都不应该发出警告。"

msgid ""
"Trivial and small patches usually are best done in one commit. Medium to "
"large work may be split into multiple commits if it makes sense."
msgstr ""
"随意和小型的补丁通常最好在一次提交中完成。如果有意义，可以将中型到大型工作分"
"成多个提交。"

msgid ""
"Practicality beats purity, so it is up to each merger to decide how much "

msgid ""
"If you bring something up on |django-developers| and nobody responds, please "

"Operating-system vendors and other distributors of Django who provide a "

"contact address for reporting issues with their Django package, or for "
"general security reporting. In either case, such addresses **must not** "
"forward to public mailing lists or bug trackers. Addresses which forward to "
"the private email of an individual maintainer or security-response contact "
"are acceptable, although private security trackers or security-response "
"groups are strongly preferred."
