"arises we'll follow the votes."
msgstr ""
"尽管 |django-developers| 上的投票是非正式的, 它们还是会被认真地对待。 在合适"

"<technical-board>`."
msgstr ""
"然而，并不是每次都能达成共识。如果不能达成共识，或者如果没有做出具体决定而达"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ticket has not been reviewed by anyone who felt qualified to make a "

msgid "Accepted"
msgstr ""

msgid ""

"Beyond that there are several considerations:"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Accepted + No Flags**"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ticket is valid, but no one has submitted a patch for it yet. Often this "
"means you could safely start writing a patch for it. This is generally more "
"true for the case of accepted bugs than accepted features. A ticket for a "
"bug that has been accepted means that the issue has been verified by at "
"least one triager as a legitimate bug - and should probably be fixed if "
"possible. An accepted new feature may only mean that one triager thought the "
"feature would be good to have, but this alone does not represent a consensus "
"view or imply with any certainty that a patch will be accepted for that "
"feature. Seek more feedback before writing an extensive patch if you are in "
"doubt."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Accepted + Has Patch**"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ticket is waiting for people to review the supplied patch. This means "
"downloading the patch and trying it out, verifying that it contains tests "
"and docs, running the test suite with the included patch, and leaving "
"feedback on the ticket."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Accepted + Has Patch + Needs ...**"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This means the ticket has been reviewed, and has been found to need further "

msgid "Ready For Checkin"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ticket was reviewed by any member of the community other than the person "
"who supplied the patch and found to meet all the requirements for a commit-"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Pull requests at GitHub have only two states: open and closed. The committer "

"Instead, we would rather only have one commit containing all your work."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To rework the history of your branch you can squash the commits into one by "

"The HEAD~2 above is shorthand for two latest commits. The above command will "
"open an editor showing the two commits, prefixed with the word \"pick\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Change \"pick\" on the second line to \"squash\" instead. This will keep the "

"the editor. A second editor window should open, so you can reword the commit "
"message for the commit now that it includes both your steps."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also use the \"edit\" option in rebase. This way you can change a "
"single commit, for example to fix a typo in a docstring::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If your topic branch is already published at GitHub, for example if you're "
"making minor changes to take into account a review, you will need to force-"
"push the changes::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that this will rewrite history of ticket_xxxxx - if you check the "
"commit hashes before and after the operation at GitHub you will notice that "
"the commit hashes do not match anymore. This is acceptable, as the branch is "
"a topic branch, and nobody should be basing their work on it."
msgstr ""

msgid "After upstream has changed"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When upstream (``django/django``) has changed, you should rebase your work. "
"To do this, use::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The work is automatically rebased using the branch you forked on, in the "
"example case using ``upstream/master``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The rebase command removes all your local commits temporarily, applies the "
"upstream commits, and then applies your local commits again on the work."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If there are merge conflicts, you will need to resolve them and then use "
"``git rebase --continue``. At any point you can use ``git rebase --abort`` "
"to return to the original state."
msgstr ""

msgid "Note that you want to *rebase* on upstream, not *merge* the upstream."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The reason for this is that by rebasing, your commits will always be *on top "
"of* the upstream's work, not *mixed in with* the changes in the upstream. "
"This way your branch will contain only commits related to its topic, which "
"makes squashing easier."
msgstr ""

msgid "After review"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is unusual to get any non-trivial amount of code into core without "
"changes requested by reviewers. In this case, it is often a good idea to add "
"the changes as one incremental commit to your work. This allows the reviewer "
"to easily check what changes you have done."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this case, do the changes required by the reviewer. Commit as often as "
"necessary. Before publishing the changes, rebase your work. If you added two "
"commits, you would run::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Squash the second commit into the first. Write a commit message along the "
"lines of::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, push your work back to your GitHub repository. Since you didn't "
"touch the public commits during the rebase, you should not need to force-"
"push::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Your pull request should now contain the new commit too."

"Note that the committer is likely to squash the review commit into the "
"previous commit when committing the code."
msgstr ""

msgid "Working on a patch"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One of the ways that developers can contribute to Django is by reviewing "
"patches. Those patches will typically exist as pull requests on GitHub and "
"can be easily integrated into your local repository::"

"example, instead of putting the entire description of a new or changed "
"feature in a block, do something like this::"

"Documentation fixes generally will be more freely backported to the last "

msgstr ""

msgid "Release cycle"
msgstr ""

msgid "Each release cycle consists of three parts:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Phase one: feature proposal"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first phase of the release process will include figuring out what major "
"features to include in the next version. This should include a good deal of "
"preliminary work on those features -- working code trumps grand design."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Major features for an upcoming release will be added to the wiki roadmap "
"page, e.g. https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/Version1.11Roadmap."
msgstr ""

msgid "Phase two: development"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The second part of the release schedule is the \"heads-down\" working "
"period. Using the roadmap produced at the end of phase one, we'll all work "
"very hard to get everything on it done."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"At the end of phase two, any unfinished features will be postponed until the "
"next release."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Phase two will culminate with an alpha release. At this point, the ``stable/"
"A.B.x`` branch will be forked from ``master``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Phase three: bugfixes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The last part of a release cycle is spent fixing bugs -- no new features "
"will be accepted during this time. We'll try to release a beta release one "
"month after the alpha and a release candidate one month after the beta."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The release candidate marks the string freeze, and it happens at least two "
"weeks before the final release. After this point, new translatable strings "
"must not be added."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"During this phase, committers will be more and more conservative with "
"backports, to avoid introducing regressions. After the release candidate, "
"only release blockers and documentation fixes should be backported."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In parallel to this phase, ``master`` can receive new features, to be "

msgstr ""

msgid "Bug-fix releases"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After a feature release (e.g. A.B), the previous release will go into bugfix "
"mode."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The branch for the previous feature release (e.g. ``stable/A.B-1.x``) will "
"include bugfixes. Critical bugs fixed on master must *also* be fixed on the "
"bugfix branch; this means that commits need to cleanly separate bug fixes "
"from feature additions. The developer who commits a fix to master will be "
"responsible for also applying the fix to the current bugfix branch."

msgid ""
"**Short version: please report security issues by emailing "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Instead, if you believe you've found something in Django which has security "

"that only affect the master development branch and not any stable released "
"versions are fixed in public without going through the :ref:`disclosure "
"process <security-disclosure>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The two most recent Django release series receive security support. For "
"example, during the development cycle leading to the release of Django 1.5, "

"Django 1.5, Django 1.3's security support will end."

"When new releases are issued for security reasons, the accompanying notice "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Approximately one week before public disclosure, we send two notifications:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First, we notify |django-announce| of the date and approximate time of the "
"upcoming security release, as well as the severity of the issues. This is to "
"aid organizations that need to ensure they have staff available to handle "
"triaging our announcement and upgrade Django as needed. Severity levels are:"
msgstr ""

msgid "**High**:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Remote code execution"
msgstr ""

msgid "SQL injection"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Moderate**:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Cross site scripting (XSS)"

msgid "Issues requiring an uncommon configuration option"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Second, we notify a list of :ref:`people and organizations <security-"
"notifications>`, primarily composed of operating-system vendors and other "
"distributors of Django. This email is signed with the PGP key of someone "
"from `Django's release team`_ and consists of:"
msgstr ""

msgid "A full description of the issue and the affected versions of Django."
msgstr ""

msgid "The steps we will be taking to remedy the issue."
msgstr ""

msgid "The patch(es), if any, that will be applied to Django."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The date on which the Django team will apply these patches, issue new "
"releases and publicly disclose the issue."
msgstr ""

msgid "On the day of disclosure, we will take the following steps:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Apply the relevant patch(es) to Django's codebase."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Issue the relevant release(s), by placing new packages on `the Python "
"Package Index`_ and on the Django website, and tagging the new release(s) in "
"Django's git repository."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Post a public entry on `the official Django development blog`_, describing "
"the issue and its resolution in detail, pointing to the relevant patches and "
"new releases, and crediting the reporter of the issue (if the reporter "
"wishes to be publicly identified)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Post a notice to the |django-announce| and oss-security@lists.openwall.com "
"mailing lists that links to the blog post."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a reported issue is believed to be particularly time-sensitive -- due to "
"a known exploit in the wild, for example -- the time between advance "
"notification and public disclosure may be shortened considerably."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Additionally, if we have reason to believe that an issue reported to us "
"affects other frameworks or tools in the Python/web ecosystem, we may "
"privately contact and discuss those issues with the appropriate maintainers, "
"and coordinate our own disclosure and resolution with theirs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Django team also maintains an :doc:`archive of security issues disclosed "
"in Django</releases/security>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Who receives advance notification"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The full list of people and organizations who receive advance notification "
"of security issues is not and will not be made public."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We also aim to keep this list as small as effectively possible, in order to "
"better manage the flow of confidential information prior to disclosure. As "
"such, our notification list is *not* simply a list of users of Django, and "
"being a user of Django is not sufficient reason to be placed on the "
"notification list."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In broad terms, recipients of security notifications fall into three groups:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Operating-system vendors and other distributors of Django who provide a "
"suitably-generic (i.e., *not* an individual's personal email address) "
"contact address for reporting issues with their Django package, or for "
"general security reporting. In either case, such addresses **must not** "
"forward to public mailing lists or bug trackers. Addresses which forward to "
"the private email of an individual maintainer or security-response contact "
"are acceptable, although private security trackers or security-response "
"groups are strongly preferred."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On a case-by-case basis, individual package maintainers who have "
"demonstrated a commitment to responding to and responsibly acting on these "
"notifications."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On a case-by-case basis, other entities who, in the judgment of the Django "
"development team, need to be made aware of a pending security issue. "
"Typically, membership in this group will consist of some of the largest and/"
"or most likely to be severely impacted known users or distributors of "
"Django, and will require a demonstrated ability to responsibly receive, keep "
"confidential and act on these notifications."
msgstr ""

msgid "Security audit and scanning entities"

msgid "Requesting notifications"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you believe that you, or an organization you are authorized to represent, "

"notifications."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The email address you would like to have added to our notification list."
msgstr ""
