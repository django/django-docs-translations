This repository is dedicated to the translation of the Django documentation.
https://docs.djangoproject.com/

To contribute translations to this project, please use the `Transifex platform
<https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/django-docs/>`_.

We currently only translate stable documentation versions. That's why the master
branch is empty. See the latest stable/3.?.x branch for real content: for
example, `stable/3.0.x <https://github.com/django/django-docs-translations/tree/stable/3.0.x>`_.
