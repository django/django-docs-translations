Before Django 1.5, applications that wanted to use Django's auth framework (:mod:`django.contrib.auth`) were forced to use Django's definition of a \"user\". In Django 1.5, you can now swap out the ``User`` model for one that you write yourself. This could be a simple extension to the existing ``User`` model -- for example, you could add a Twitter or Facebook ID field -- or you could completely replace the ``User`` with one totally customized for your site."
