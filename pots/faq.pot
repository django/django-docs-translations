msgid "Another reason that bugs might be ignored for while is if the bug is a symptom of a larger problem. While we can spend time writing, testing and applying lots of little patches, sometimes the right solution is to rebuild. If a rebuild or refactor of a particular component has been proposed or is underway, you may find that bugs affecting that component will not get as much attention. Again, this is just a matter of prioritizing scarce resources. By concentrating on the rebuild, we can close all the little bugs at once, and hopefully prevent other little bugs from appearing in the future."

msgid "Whatever the reason, please keep in mind that while you may hit a particular bug regularly, it doesn't necessarily follow that every single Django user will hit the same bug. Different users use Django in different ways, stressing different parts of the code under different conditions. When we evaluate the relative priorities, we are generally trying to consider the needs of the entire community, not just the severity for one particular user. This doesn't mean that we think your problem is unimportant -- just that in the limited time we have available, we will always err on the side of making 10 people happy rather than making 1 person happy."
