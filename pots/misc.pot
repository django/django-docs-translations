msgid ":doc:`The release of Django 1.0 </releases/1.0>` comes with a promise of API stability and forwards-compatibility. In a nutshell, this means that code you develop against a 1.X version of Django will continue to work with future 1.X releases. You may need to make minor changes when upgrading the version of Django your project uses: see the \"Backwards incompatible changes\" section of the :doc:`release note </releases/index>` for the version or versions to which you are upgrading."
